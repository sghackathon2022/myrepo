0,"Home Depot workers petition to form 1st store-wide union
NEW YORK (AP) —

Home Depot workers in Philadelphia have filed a petition with the federal labor board to form what could be the first store-wide union at the world's largest home improvement retailer.

The petition, filed with the National Labor Relations Board this week, seeks to form a collective bargaining unit for 274 employees who work in merchandising, specialty and operations. The federal agency's database shows no other attempts to form a store-wide union at the company, though a group of Home Depot drivers successfully unionized with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in 2019.

Sara Gorman, a Home Depot spokesperson, said the company is aware of the filing and “we look forward to talking to our associates about their concerns.”

“While we will of course work through the NLRB process, we do not believe unionization is the best solution for our associates,” Gorman said in an email.

Vincent Quiles, a store employee who is leading the petition, said he delivered the petition with 103 workers' signatures to the federal labor board Tuesday.

He said discontent with compensation and working conditions rose as employees felt strained during the pandemic.

Quiles, who makes $19.25 an hour in the receiving department, said he and other workers felt they could have benefited more from the record profits Home Depot made during the pandemic, as demand grew for home improvement projects. He pointed to two bonuses he received last year that amounted to less than $400.

Meanwhile, Quiles said his store felt perpetually understaffed, and employees were routinely asked to work in other departments with little training, sometimes angering customers when they could not provide the expertise expected of them.

“I would see corporate visits. They would say you're doing a great job, you are so essential. You have to walk the walk. You can't just come in here and say a bunch of nice things,” Quiles said. “This is a long shot but I think we can do this. This is just the beginning.”

Home Depot, based in Atlanta, employs about 500,000 people at its 2,316 stores in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

Worker discontent has galvanized labor movements at several major companies in the U.S. in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which sparked tensions over sick leave policies, scheduling, safety and other issues.

In a surprise victory, Amazon workers at a Staten Island warehouse voted in favor of unionizing in April, though similar efforts at other warehouses so far have been unsuccessful. At least 238 U.S. Starbucks stores have voted to unionize over the past year, according to the NLRB. Last week, rail workers won key concessions in a tentative agreement with rail companies that averted a potentially devastating shutdown of the nation's freight trains.",Home|Depot|NE|##W|Y|##OR|##K|AP|Home|Depot|National|Labor|Relations|Board|Home|Depot|International|Brotherhood|of|Teams|##ters|Home|Depot|NL|##RB|##uil|Home|Depot|Q|##uil|Depot|U|

Guinea-Ecowas-Transition-Sanctions Ecowas threatens tough sanctions on Guinea

APA - Dakar (Senegal)

President Umaro Sissoco Embalo of Guinea Bissau in his capacity as chair of the West African regional bloc is threatening tough sanctions against Guinea should its military rulers stick to their 36-month transition timetable.

By Abdou Cisse

President Embalo, who holds the rotating chairmanship of the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) since July, asked the Guinean authorities in an interview with Radio France Internationale (Rfi) and France 24 to reduce the transition period to 24 months.

This comes 24 hours before the extraordinary summit of the Conference of Heads of State of Ecowas in New York, on the sidelines of the 77th UN General Assembly.

Reflecting the position of Ecowas, Embalo said the 36-month transition timetable set by Conakry are unacceptable.

In a thinly-veiled threat Embalo added: “If the junta maintains the three years, there will be heavy sanctions. We cannot accept that''.

After the September 5, 2021 putsch against former President Alpha Conde, Ecowas had suspended Guinea from its membership before imposing individual sanctions against the putschists.

At its ordinary session on July 3, the regional grouping maintained its position on a military junta-led Guinea.

It also appointed former Benin president Thomas Boni Yayi as Ecowas mediator for the country tasked with negotiating a transition timetable acceptable to Ecowas by August 1, 2022.

Since then, the former head of state of Benin has visited Conakry twice without success, although he welcomed the establishment of an inclusive consultation framework to facilitate the return to constitutional order during his last visit (August 21-27).

However, this is being boycotted by key opposition figures, in a context of repression of the National Front for the Defense of the Constitution (FNDC), the main architect of the campaign against Conde's third bid for the presidency.

The organization was dissolved by the ruling junta, which accused it of subversive activities, and its leaders sent to prison.

South Africa-Corruption-Lottery S/African court freezes pension payment for graft-accused lottery chief

APA-Johannesburg (South Africa)

The Special Tribunal has granted the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) a preservation order to freeze pension benefits of corruption-accused former National Lotteries Commission (NLC) chief operating officer Philemon Letwaba, APA learnt here on Thursday.

The Special Tribunal order interdicts the Liberty Group — the pension administrator — from paying out pension benefits valued at around R2.8 million (about US$160,000) that is due to Letwaba pending the outcome of investigations into the activities of the former NLC official.

The SIU sought the Special Tribunal’s intervention to freeze the pension benefits of Letwaba after he resigned from the NLC pending the institution of a disciplinary hearing into his role in the distribution of lottery funds to several non-profit organisations.

An investigation by the SIU in the affairs of NLC had revealed that Letwaba allegedly benefited personally from monies received by the organisations.

The official is alleged to have used friends and family businesses and trusts to receive money from the non-profit organisations for his personal benefit.

In one of the cases, a non-profit organisation based in Limpopo province received approximately R25 million for the refurbishment of a school that had been destroyed by fire. However, 12 days later the organisation allegedly transferred approximately R4 million to a company with links to Letwaba without evidence of work being done.

4,"Denver judge rejects GOP residency complaint against Democratic candidate in pivotal state Senate district
A Democrat running to represent a state Senate district in a 2022 race that could determine whether Republicans reclaim some power at the Colorado Capitol next year survived a GOP challenge to his candidacy Wednesday.

After a daylong hearing that featured testimony from a private investigator and questions from two high-powered partisan attorneys, Denver District Court Judge Alex C. Myers ruled late Wednesday that state Rep. Kyle Mullica, a Democrat, did not violate a requirement that candidates for Colorado statehouse seats live in the district they are running to represent for a year before Election Day.

The Unaffiliated is our twice-weekly newsletter on Colorado politics and policy.

Mullica is running to represent Senate District 24 in a closely watched race against Republican Courtney Potter, an Adams 12 Five Star Schools board member. Until November of last year he was registered to vote at his family’s home in Northglenn, where his wife was a city council member. But on Nov. 4, 2021, he changed his voter registration to his mother’s house in Federal Heights.

Mullica says he moved in with his mother to help her manage some health and financial issues. His wife and children stayed in Northglenn.

The house in Federal Heights is in Senate District 24, a competitive district in Adams County mostly east of Interstate 25. The home in Northglenn is in Senate District 25, where incumbent state Sen. Faith Winter, a Westminster Democrat, is running for reelection in November.

In April, Mullica and his family moved into a newly built home in Thornton, which is also in Senate District 24. The winner of the District 24 race could determine whether Democrats or Republicans have the majority in the Senate in 2023 and 2024.

Two District 24 voters, Rebecca Elmore and Thomas J. Scovill, filed a residency challenge against Mullica last week, claiming that Mullica hadn’t actually moved into the district last year. Elmore is an unaffiliated voter and Scovill is a Republican. The pair are represented by Suzanne Taheri, a Republican lawyer who used to be Colorado’s deputy secretary of state and often serves as the attorney for conservative political groups.

The complaint filed by Elmore and Scovill included a report from a private investigator and photographs of Mullica and his family at their Northglenn home in March.

However, the investigator, Ryan Zahn, testified Wednesday that he didn’t monitor Mullica’s whereabouts overnight and so he couldn’t say whether Mullica spent the night at the Northglenn home at the times he photographed the lawmaker and his vehicle there.

Mullica testified, under questioning from former 18th Judicial District Attorney George Brauchler, a Republican, that he would frequently visit his family at the Northglenn home — and sometimes spend the night there — but that he always intended his residence to be his mother’s Federal Heights home after moving there in November 2021. Mullica said moving into his mom’s house was a difficult decision because it meant he couldn’t run for reelection to his House seat, but that she was facing physical and mental health challenges and was struggling with her finances.

“The Senate district lines were not a part of the conversation,” he testified, explaining that he first started discussing whether to move in with his mother in October 2021.

Mullica said when he realized he could run for the Senate District 24 seat after moving, he jumped at the opportunity. “I wanted to still have that opportunity to serve my community, so I decided to run for Senate District 24.”

Eventually, Mullica said, he and his wife, Julie, decided to move into a home in Thornton in District 24 to accommodate their growing family. She resigned from her position on the Northglenn City Council as a result.

Residency for the purposes of voting and for holding office can be difficult to define in Colorado, which has opened the door for challenges. There have been a number of high-profile cases in recent years in which politicians’ and voters’ residencies have come under scrutiny.

State law defines a person’s residence as “the principal or primary home or place of abode … in which a person’s habitation is fixed and to which that person, whenever absent, has the present intention of returning after a departure or absence, regardless of the duration of the absence.”

Myers, the judge overseeing the case, said his ruling was a “close call,” but that he found Mullica’s explanation of why he moved credible.

“It is apparent that Rep. Mullica genuinely wanted to care for his mother and moved for that purpose,” Myers wrote.

Brauchler pressed Mullica about his mother’s health, how many nights he stayed at his family’s house in Northglenn after changing his voter registration to the Federal Heights address and why Mullica didn’t change his address on his nursing license as required.

(Mullica said he intends to change the address on his nursing license in a few weeks when it’s up for renewal. He pointed out that he changed his address for his hunting and fishing license and for his mileage reimbursement for his work at the Capitol.)

Elmore and Scovill, who weren’t in court Wednesday, could appeal the decision. Taheri declined to say who is funding the residency challenge, citing attorney-client privilege.

Taheri works for several conservative political nonprofits that don’t have to disclose their donors — groups that The Colorado Sun refers to as dark-money organizations. Brauchler is the president of one of those nonprofits: Advance Colorado Academy.

Mullica is one of several state lawmakers whose residency qualifications have been questioned in recent months after last year’s once-a-decade redistricting process. Outgoing state Sen. Pete Lee, D-Colorado Springs, was indicted on a felony charge in August on suspicion of lying about his address for the purpose of voting. A Democratic dark-money group asked El Paso County prosecutors to probe whether Republican Sen. Dennis Hisey committed the same crime.

Both men have denied wrongdoing.

Questions have also been raised about the residency of Democratic state Rep. Tracey Bernett, of Boulder County, who has refused to discuss where she lives with The Sun.

5,"CT’s big hospital systems are buying up private practices and small hospitals. What does that mean?
Original reporting by Katy Golvala, Erica E. Phillips, Dave Altimari and Nicole McIsaac. Compiled by Nicole McIsaac.

Connecticut’s health care industry is becoming increasingly concentrated.

In return, some small private practices in the state are finding it difficult to compete with big health care systems. Instead of struggling to stay afloat, many are joining them.

As of January, hospitals owned 26% of physician practices nationwide, up from 14% a decade ago. An additional 27% of practices were owned by a corporation, leaving fewer than half of physician practices under independent ownership.

Connecticut is no exception. Here’s what you need to know.

Hospital mergers are changing the way people in CT receive care

In Connecticut, two systems — Yale New Haven and Hartford HealthCare — are on the brink of owning more than half the 27 hospitals in the state.

Today, the state has six independent hospitals. Only one of Connecticut’s four rural hospitals remains independent — and it’s not likely to stay that way.

While regionalizing health care services in this way can improve the bottom line for hospital systems, it leaves some patients farther away from the medical care they need.

Service cuts often follow acquisitions. The cuts have had a particularly strong impact on the state’s rural labor and delivery landscape.

Large hospital systems in CT are also acquiring private practices

Together, the state’s five health systems account for more than a quarter of the around 17,000 physicians licensed to practice in the state.

Reports filed to the Office of Health Strategy show that Hartford HealthCare has been acquiring physician practices most actively over the last several years.

Since 2015, Hartford HealthCare has acquired 14 practices and 59 doctors, according to publicly available notices of material change.

Concentrated health care services can mean higher costs

When health systems acquire hospitals and small physician practices, it has economic consequences.

Researchers have connected hospital consolidation to rising health care costs. That, in turn, has driven up the cost of health insurance plans for many small businesses and nonprofits in Connecticut, who are increasingly struggling to offer health care benefits as rates rise each year — often by double digits.

Research has also shown that vertical integration, where hospital systems buy up smaller practices, drives up costs for patients in two ways. First, larger hospital systems are able to negotiate higher rates with insurance companies than private practices for the same level of care. So when a practice gets acquired by a hospital system, its prices go up.

Second, small practices that have become part of a larger health system are more likely to send their patients to hospitals within the system for follow-up services. While convenient — the patient’s records stay within the system — the larger system has more power to set higher prices, which can cost the patient more.

Lawsuit challenges Hartford HealthCare’s acquisitions as ‘anti-competitive’

Saint Francis Hospital, owned by Trinity Health of New England, filed a federal lawsuit alleging that Hartford HealthCare pushed it out of the market by buying up doctors’ practices and used certain clauses in its contracts with insurers that drove up health care prices and insurance premiums by limiting options for consumers.

Hartford HealthCare said its behavior does not qualify as “anti-competitive,” as the lawsuit claims.

In a motion to dismiss the case, Hartford HealthCare’s lawyers argued that Saint Francis should simply “compete harder to recruit and retain physicians.”

During this year’s Connecticut General Assembly session, a bill aimed at rooting out some of the same anti-competitive practices alleged in the lawsuit stalled.",CT|Yale|New|Haven|Hartford|Health|##C|##are|Office|of|Health|Strategy|Hartford|Health|##C|##are|Hartford|Health|##C|##are|First|
6,"Here are the Trump properties at the center of the New York attorney general’s lawsuit against the former President and his family
CNN —

New York Attorney General Letitia James on Wednesday filed a civil fraud lawsuit against former President Donald Trump, three of his children and his business.

In more than 200 pages, the lawsuit alleges that the defendants were involved in an expansive fraud lasting over a decade that the former President used to enrich himself, and that the fraud touched all aspects of the Trump business, including its properties and golf courses.

Here’s a breakdown of some of the notable properties mentioned in the lawsuit:

1. Mar-a-Lago

The New York attorney general’s lawsuit alleges Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property in Florida was valued “as high as $739 million based on the false premise that it was unrestricted property and could be developed and sold for residential use,” and continues, “in reality, the club generated annual revenues of less than $25 million and should have been valued at closer to $75 million.”

2. Trump Tower

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Spencer Platt/Getty Images

James said that Trump inflated the square footage of his Trump Tower triplex apartment in order to misrepresent the value at over $300 million. “Mr. Trump represented that his apartments spanned more than 30,000 square feet, which was the basis for valuing the apartment. In reality, the apartment had an area of less than 11,000 square feet, something that Mr. Trump was well aware of,” James said. “Based on that inflated square footage, the value of the apartment in 2015, in 2016, was $327 million. To this date, no apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount.”

3. Trump Park Avenue

Trump Park Avenue was appraised in 2010 to be worth approximately $72.5 million, according to the lawsuit. But Trump’s company claimed in subsequent financial statements that the property was worth roughly $292 million, according to the lawsuit. The property near Central Park includes high-end residential units, commercial spaces and storage spaces.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) Win McNamee/Getty Images

The lawsuit from James accuses former President Donald Trump of using allegedly doctored financial statements in his and Ivanka Trump’s personal pursuit to open a luxury hotel in Washington, DC, in the years before he ran for the presidency. It became a hub for his supporters and close contacts, and bookings grew because of the connection to the sitting president.

5. Trump International Hotel and Tower — Las Vegas, Nevada

The Trump hotel in Las Vegas – a hotel condominium of which Trump owns half – had misleading financial statements between 2013 and 2021, the suit alleges, due to income projections based on the sale of residential units that assumed prices much higher that what units were selling for, among other reasons.

6. 40 Wall Street

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - OCTOBER 01: A view of the Trump Building on Wall Street in lower manhattan on October 01, 2021 in New York City. (Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images) Roy Rochlin/Getty Images

James also highlighted what she says happened with 40 Wall Street, a property in New York City’s financial district, which is referenced dozens of times in the lawsuit. Trump’s company got appraisals for the property in 2010 and 2012, which found that it was worth $200 million and $220 million respectively, according to the lawsuit. But Trump’s company repeatedly claimed that the property was worth a lot more in its official financial statements, according to the lawsuit.

7. Trump golf courses

The lawsuit argues the Trump Organization also used a variety of deceptive or inappropriate methods to inflate the value of Trump’s golf courses. For example, the organization added 30% to the value of various golf courses to account for a Trump “brand premium,” despite what the suit describes as rules against such practices. Trump claimed a club, Trump National Golf Club, Jupiter, purchased for $5 million in 2012 jumped to a worth of a $62 million in 2013.

8. Licensing deals

Many of the Trump Organization’s ventures involve licensing deals, in which another party owns the property and pays Trump to use his brand. The lawsuit alleges that Trump’s business inflated the value of its overall licensing business by including “speculative and non-existent deals” between 2015 and 2018. Some of those speculative deals involved potential overseas arrangements. The suit argues that including them in the valuations in 2016 and 2017 was misleading because the Trump Organization purportedly stopped seeking foreign deals after Trump took office. The licensing deals’ value were further boosted by including deals between business entities owned by the Trump Organization, according to the suit. According to former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, “licensing was generally handled by Ivanka” and brothers Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump were well aware of the actual revenue derived from licensing in general, according to the lawsuit.",CNN|FBI|##UT|##ER|##S|Marco|##o|Re|##uters|Trump|Organization|Get|##ty|Images|Spencer|P|##latt|/|Get|##ty|Images|James|
7,"Opinion: California should better harness automated smart tech
The following commentary was written by Amanda Myers Wisser, the policy and regulatory lead for Western states at WeaveGrid. WeaveGrid is the technology provider for the evPulse for Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) pilot program. See our commentary guidelines for more information.

So far this year, California has been able to stave off rotating outages, despite a new peak demand record during the recent week-long heat wave that closely resembled the conditions that triggered rotating outages in August 2020. California has been preparing for extreme heat to reappear, and all of the planning work has paid off for addressing this near-term challenge. However, the state should continue to improve its response to and readiness for grid constraints resulting from extreme weather events. In particular, California can better utilize the suite of automated smart technologies at its fingertips to reduce electricity and attention demands from Californians.

Through ambitious climate goals, California has cultivated a strong climate tech ecosystem. For example, electric vehicles are now the state’s number one export and top talent from California’s famous Silicon Valley is flocking to climate-focused technology companies. As California decarbonizes its grid and electrifies its other economic sectors, there is ample opportunity for technology to play a role in creating a better grid. Automated smart technology can help orchestrate a sea of distributed energy resources (DERs) that can provide grid support without direct customer action.

Electric vehicles (EVs) are one important example of DERs that can support California’s grid. And with California’s new policy of 100% zero-emission vehicle sales by 2035, EVs are a rapidly growing class of DERs that can provide grid benefits. EVs are unique as DERs because they provide significant demand flexibility due to the ratio of charging time to plug-in/park time. EVs are also a large load as compared to other DERs, particularly in a residential setting, so need to be managed carefully. Principally, EV charging can be scheduled to be “off-peak” and dynamically controlled, which is when the grid is not as constrained, typically avoiding the late afternoon to early evening stretch where supply and demand are closest.

A prime example of tying together automatic smart EV charging and resilience measures is the recently launched evPulse for Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) pilot program, which not only automatically manages EV charging through the vehicles themselves (no costly charger required) but also sends Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) alerts to EV drivers in advance of PSPS events so EV drivers can charge up before power is potentially turned off. This pilot program boosts grid resilience by rewarding off-peak charging and boosts driver resilience by ensuring EV drivers are prepared in the case of wildfire conditions that threaten power availability.

evPulse for PG&E is just one example of a few automated technology programs in California, but on the whole, we need more policies and programs that allow customers to take a hands-off but climate- and cost-friendly approach to responding to grid challenges with the suite of power-consuming devices they may have.

Text messages that request shutting down power are effective but eventually may lead to consumer fatigue and given the importance of avoiding power outages, we must not resort to this method indefinitely. California is responding as quickly as it can to the climate and grid challenges it faces but the state needs to continue to move in the direction of relying on fewer manual responses from customers as customers electrify their homes and businesses. We simply cannot afford to make the transition to electrification burdensome.

As California does the hard but critical work of designing a climate-friendly future, it will undoubtedly continue to face challenges. The state should tap into its advanced technology industry to perform sophisticated grid functions rather than interrupting work and personal lives to keep our grid going through manual action. There are better ways to operate — let’s put our smart devices to work.",We|##ave|##G|##rid|We|##ave|##G|##rid|Pacific|Gas|and|Electric|Company|P|##G|&|E|Pacific|

“It was volunteer, offered transport to sanctuary jurisdictions, because it’s our view that, one, the border should be secured, and we want to have Biden reinstitute policies like ‘Remain in Mexico’ and make sure that people aren’t overwhelming,” he continued.

“But short of that, if you believe in open borders, and this is sanctuary jurisdictions that should have to bear the brunt of the open borders. So that’s what we’re doing,” he said.

Information on the lawsuit from The New York Post:

The migrants, the suit contends, were duped into boarding planes in Texas with promises of jobs, gift cards and without being fully informed of their final destination.

“No human being should be used as a political pawn,” said Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of Lawyers for Civil Rights, the organization that filed the suit in Boston federal court. DeSantis questioned where the outrage is when migrants are being abused by the cartels, when migrants drown in the Rio Grande, when 50 migrants are found dead in an abandoned sweltering truck, or when huge amounts of fentanyl are being smuggled across the border.

DeSantis’ office also released an official statement and proof that all migrants signed a consent form. Town Hall contributor Julio Rosas shared details on Twitter.

10,"State employees likely to get 1K bonuses for COVID booster
SEATTLE (AP) — Under a tentative deal Washington state employees would get $1,000 bonuses for receiving a COVID-19 booster shot.

The agreement between the state and the Washington Federation of State Employees also includes 4% pay raises in 2023, 3% pay raises in 2024 and a $1,000 retention bonus, The Seattle Times reported.

Gov. Jay Inslee announced this month that all pandemic emergency orders will end by Oct. 31, including state vaccine mandates for health care and education workers. But he has said a vaccine mandate will continue to be in effect for workers at most state agencies.

Most employees were required to have their initial series of vaccination by October of last year or be fired. New state employees have had to be vaccinated before their official start date.

“We want to have healthy people so people don’t miss work,” Inslee said earlier this month. “The vaccine still remains a very important thing.”

The Washington Federation of State Employees represents nearly 47,000 workers with roughly 35,000 state employees impacted by the tentative deal. The union said it would “help address widespread staffing shortages and workplace safety issues.”

The union called the deal, which still must be approved by both sides, the highest compensation package in the union’s history.

Inslee’s office declined to speak to the specifics of the tentative agreement announced by the union.

Offering incentives for boosters “reflects the feedback and recommendations we heard from employees and labor partners,” Jaime Smith, an Inslee spokesperson, said.",SE|##AT|##TL|##E|AP|Washington|Federation|of|State|Em|##p|The|Seattle|Times|Washington|Federation|of|State|Em|##loy|##ees|In|##sle|##e|

MP: Two more held for pro-Pak slogans in Shajapur; case registered in Chhatarpur

SOURCE: PTI

Police have arrested two more men in connection with the raising of pro-Pakistan slogans during a Muharram procession in Madhya Pradesh’s Shajapur district while a case was registered in Chhatarpur for an objectionable social media post, officials said on Tuesday.

“Madhya Pradesh Police has taken action in two cases related to raising slogans or making posts in favour of Pakistan in two cases in Madhya Pradesh’s Shajapur and Chhatarpur districts, state home minister Narottam Mishra told reporters.

He said those who raised slogans in support of Pakistan have been arrested.

“There is rule of law in Madhya Pradesh and only chanting of ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ is allowed in the state,” Mishra said.

Chhatarpur Superintendent of Police Sachin Sharma said a case was registered after a complaint was filed by VHP and Bajrang Dal regarding an objectionable post with provocative slogans on social media. The content was allegedly posted from the user ID of a 17-year-old boy.

The case was registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and further investigation is underway, he said.

The action was taken by the police after Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal filed a complaint at Rajnagar police station, some 45 km away from the Chhatarpur district headquarters.

Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) office-bearer Anupam Gupta said a memorandum was submitted after ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogans were posted on Instagram and Facebook and abusive words were used for India with an intention to disrupt communal harmony. In Shajapur district, police arrested two more men on Monday, more than a month after slogans were raised in the support of Pakistan during Muharram on August 10, Shajapur police station in-charge Premlata Khatri said, adding that the total of four persons have been arrested in the case so far after the video of the incident surfaced.",Indian|Defence|Research|Wing|PT|##I|Police|Madhya|Pradesh|Police|V|##HP|Ba|##j|##rang|Dal|Indian|Pen|##al|Code|IP|##C|V|##ish|##wa|Hindu|Parish|##ad|V|##HP|Ba|##j|##rang|Dal|V|##ish|##wa|Hindu|Parish|##ad|V|##HP|Z|##inda|##bad|S|
12,"Update: County releases trove of emails between Communications Director and media members
(Update, Sept. 23): Ithaca Alderperson Jeffrey Barken has published a reaction to the new emails released by the county and Tompkins County Legislature Chair Shawna Black’s comments at Tuesday’s meeting.

Barken first lodged allegations of undue media influence by Tompkins County Communications Director Dominick Recckio regarding the Reimagining Public Safety process. Black, in her first comments on the matter, called Barken’s claims “baseless and defamatory.” But Barken argued in his post on Thursday that the newly released emails, as detailed below, actually show “a pattern of improper influence and a series of problematic interactions between a placating editor and [their] censor,” referring to Tompkins Weekly editor Jessica Wickham and Recckio, though Barken continues not to name them directly, as he avoided in his original comments. He also did not expound on the multiple investigations he has said are underway into the matter.

Wickham has stated previously they never felt threatened by Recckio’s communications or concerns, but Barken insists that the emails are inappropriate and evidence of wrongdoing and paints the exchange as “chilling.” The full exchange can be read below, and Barken’s full statements are at the link above.

Original Story:

TOMPKINS COUNTY, N.Y.—Tompkins County’s response to allegations of media influencing continued Tuesday evening with the release of just over 800 PDFs that show about 20 months’ worth of e-mails between county Communications Director Dominick Recckio and members of the local media regarding Reimagining Public Safety.

Your government news is made possible with support from:

The allegations emerged two weeks ago when Alderperson Jeffrey Barken raised them during a privilege of the floor comment at an Ithaca Common Council meeting. Barken has been among the most vocal critics of the Reimagining Public Safety process on Common Council, and his speech seemed to have two main prongs: partially about press freedom, but moreso trying to assert a point about the strain that staffing issues at the Ithaca Police Department have put on emergency services in Ithaca and nearby.

County leadership has repeatedly stated that they have reviewed the matter and do not believe Recckio has done anything wrong.

Of the hundreds of e-mails released from the beginning of 2021 onward, which have been reviewed by The Ithaca Voice, only a few seem relevant to the issue at hand, indicative of the sweeping nature of the FOIL requests. The vast majority are press releases sent by Recckio on behalf of the county to various local news outlets, as well as several brief conversations about advertising sales, primarily with Tompkins Weekly. The emails only consist of communications with The Ithaca Voice, Tompkins Weekly and The Ithaca Times.

The relevant emails are four instances of Recckio “offering corrections” or “expressing concern” regarding stories, but nothing that seems to come close to threats or retaliation for coverage — which was the most significant portion of Barken’s allegations. The emails that have been released fall within the norm for a communications director; though there are other communications that have yet to be released.

Two emails of this kind were sent to Tompkins Weekly editor Jessica Wickham, one that spawned the initial controversy regarding an Aug. 3 story featuring Trumansburg Mayor Rordan Hart’s comments on the Reimagining Public Safety process in a story by Deidra Cross and the other regarding an April column by Cross profiling right-wing organizer/activist Rocco Lucente.

Common Council member accuses county official of improper media influence around law enforcement reform See more

“I am sharing with you that I am concerned with this week’s ‘Trumansburg Connections’ column in Tompkins Weekly,” Recckio wrote. “This is peppered with lies, misleading statements and unfounded attacks on several topics, under the guise of featuring a harmless ‘activist and writer.'”

Recckio doesn’t directly ask for a change to the story, but lodges his objection to one inaccurate statement from Lucente about Ithaca intentionally dismantling its police department. Wickham said they understand, but it doesn’t appear that any changes were ultimately made to the article.

As previously reported, Wickham, whose pronouns are they/them, said they had never felt threatened by Recckio at any point in their working relationship. Cross’ freelance contract was terminated with Tompkins Weekly in the wake of the controversy, though Wickham has said that was in relation to Cross’ conduct, not the August column directly. Cross has said she plans to file a lawsuit over the situation.

Further, two corrections were offered to The Ithaca Voice, one regarding the number of police officers who have left IPD in the past few years and another regarding a July 2022 story about the Grassroots Festival failing to receive permits from the Tompkins County Health Department. Neither were accepted.

Developments have been limited since Barken’s speech on Sept. 7 , which can be read in full here. Recckio’s e-mails were released in bulk in response to FOIL requests made by several parties in the lead-up to Barken’s comments, including Barken himself, Ithaca Police Benevolent Association President Thomas Condzella, a California-based political consultant associated with the IPBA and an Ithaca business owner, Sequoia Valoy.

Tompkins County Deputy FOIL Officer Erin Murphy confirmed that there are more FOIL requests pending concerning Recckio’s emails, beyond what was fulfilled Tuesday night, meaning there are likely more emails to be released in the same manner in coming days or weeks.

Response to Barken’s comments during the actual Common Council meeting was rather muted, while Tompkins County Attorney Bill Troy announced the next day that, in the county’s view, Recckio had been cleared of any concern of wrongdoing.

Barken has publicly claimed that multiple investigations are underway into The Voice’s communications with Recckio, as well as all other local media outlets. Each public official asked by The Ithaca Voice said they were not conducting a further investigation, which includes Tompkins County District Attorney Matt Van Houten, County Administrator Lisa Holmes, Ithaca Acting Mayor Laura Lewis and Ithaca Alderperson George McGonigal (who is leading the Reimagining Public Safety Special Committee). The Ithaca Police Department did not immediately respond to The Voice’s inquiry.

Tompkins County Legislature Chair Shawna Black offered a forceful rebuke of Barken’s allegations at the legislature’s meeting Tuesday night, calling them “baseless and defamatory” while reasserting the county’s commitment to providing ample funding for law enforcement.

The matter has still not been discussed during the ongoing Ethics Advisory Board investigation into potential ethics violations during the Reimagining Public Safety formulation process.",It|##ha|##ca|Al|Tom|##p|##kins|County|Legislature|Tom|##p|##kins|County|Tom|##p|##kins|Weekly|N|Tom|##p|##kins|County|Public|Safety|Al|Bar|Common|Council|Bar|Re|Public|Common|Council|Police|Department|County|Re|
13,"Hyundai, Kia Sued in Rash of Car Thefts
Owners of Kia and Hyundai cars filed a class-action lawsuit Wednesday in federal court in Santa Ana alleging that the Orange County-based companies failed to install technology to thwart car thieves, leaving the vehicles vulnerable to a rash of thefts spurred by a video that went viral on social media.

The federal lawsuit was filed by Stephanie McQuarrie of Florida, Kaitlynn Marchione of Nevada, and Omar Becerra of Los Angeles County, who claimed their vehicles were stolen following a video on TikTok that they say exposed a vulnerability in the vehicles making them easier to steal. Kia has headquarters in Irvine and Hyundai is based in the United States out of Fountain Valley.

“This matter rises out of a blatant breach of public trust and a determination to put corporate profits over public safety,” the lawsuit alleges. “In an effort to maximize their return, defendants Kia America Inc. and Hyundai Motor America actively withheld vital security systems from countless vehicles for years. This has led to a severe defect that has already both endangered the public and drastically decreased the value of vehicles.”

The plaintiffs allege Hyundai executives considered adding “engine immobilizers” in the company’s vehicles to reduce thefts in 2007, as did Kia in 2009.

“Without the engine immobilizers, the cars can be easily hotwired and stolen, however Kia and Hyundai made no effort to warn their customers about the risk to their vehicles,” the lawsuit alleges.

Hyundai issued a statement saying the company was “concerned about the recent rise in auto thefts of certain Hyundai model vehicles. While all of our vehicles meet or exceed federal motor vehicle safety standards, unfortunately, our vehicles have been targeted in a coordinated effort on social media. Criminals are targeting our vehicles without engine immobilizers. Immobilizers became standard on all vehicles produced after November 1, 2021.

“In order to assist customers with earlier model year vehicles without an immobilizer, Hyundai has been working with and will continue to support local police departments to make steering wheel locks available for affected Hyundai owners. Additionally, Hyundai has identified a Firstech / Compustar security kit that targets the method of entry thieves are using to access these vehicles.

“Beginning October 1, 2022, this security kit will be available for purchase and installation at Hyundai dealerships and Compustar authorized installers across the country. Hyundai will provide additional details soon, and customers who have questions can always contact the Hyundai Consumer Assistance Center at 800-633-5151.”

Kia officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A TikTok “Kia Challenge” video posted in July 2022 went viral on the platform as well as on YouTube. In it, viewers are challenged to steal a Kia or Hyundai by “simply peeling back the steering column and inserting a standard USB cable,” allowing the security systems to be bypassed and igniting the engine, the lawsuit alleges.

“The Kia Challenge and the publicity regarding the defect has directly contributed to an enormous surge in vehicle thefts of the defective vehicles throughout the United States,” the lawsuit alleges. “In Los Angeles alone during 2022, Hyundai and Kia vehicles accounted for 20% of all vehicle thefts in the city, a sharp increase from only 13% the year prior. Similarly, the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin reported motor vehicle thefts had climbed 152%. In July of 2022, the city of Chicago, Illinois reported a 767% increase in Hyundai and Kia vehicle thefts.”",H|##yun|##dai|Ki|##a|Sue|##d|Ra|of|Car|The|##fts|Own|Ki|##a|H|##yun|##dai|T|##ik|##T|##ok|Ki|##a|H|##yun|##dai|Ki|##a|America|Inc|H|##yun|##dai|Motor|America|H|##yun|##dai|Ki|Ki|##a|H|##yun|##dai|H|##yun|##dai|H|##yun|##dai|

New Delhi: The Chakma Development Foundation of India (CDFI) today filed a complaint with National Human Rights Commission against the alleged false prosecution and mental harassment of Human Rights Defender (HRD) Rup Singh Chakma, President of Arunachal Pradesh Chakma Students Union (APCSU) by Deputy Commissioner of Changlang district in Arunachal Pradesh.

On 19 September 2022, the Additional Deputy Commissioner of Bordumsa issued a “summon to Rup Singh Chakma” via WhatsApp to appear before him on September 20, 2022, pursuant to the direction of the Deputy Commissioner of Changlang district dated August 23, 2022, to sign a bond under Section 107 CrPC for maintaining peace & tranquillity in the area.

“Rup Singh Chakma has been employed and working in NOIDA, Uttar Pradesh since June 2021 and is still working and living in NOIDA. He was not present in Arunachal Pradesh in August 2022. How could a person sitting in NOIDA break peace and tranquility in Arunachal Pradesh? No inquiry was conducted to even find out whether Rup Singh Chakma lives in Arunachal Pradesh. The summon is nothing but an absolute abuse of power by the Deputy Commissioner”, said Suhas Chakma, Founder of the CDFI.

The CDFI in its complaint stated, “The Summon issued to Rup Singh Chakma for the execution of good behaviour bond U/S 107 CrPC for maintaining peace & tranquillity in the area as per direction of the Deputy Commissioner appears to harass him and aimed to silence him for raising his voice against the injustice meted out to the Chakma community by the State Government. On 23 March 2022, Mr Rup Singh Chakma and other Chakma HRDs briefed full commission of the National Human Rights Commission on their deplorable situation and further, on 5 April 2022, Mr Rup Singh Chakma had organized a peaceful protest against racial discrimination and illegal census of the Chakma and Hajong communities by the State Government of Arunachal Pradesh at Jantar Mantar, New Delhi.”

The CDFI further alleged that Sunny K Singh, Deputy Commissioner of Changlang district has been systematically targeting the Chakma rights defenders.

A statement added, “Previously as Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC), Miao Sub-Division, he had initiated false proceedings against six Chakma human rights defenders from Dharmapur village under Miao Sub-Division in Changlang district in February 2022. On 29 August 2022, the NHRC issued a conditional summon to the District Magistrate (Deputy Commissioner), Changlang district to either submit the reports it sought on the harassment on or before 28.9.2022 or appear in person on 6 October 2022.”

21,"Polish spyware scandal shows the need for European rules to protect innocent citizens
“We need European rules to regulate the use of spyware technologies to avoid innocent citizens becoming victims of intrusive and illegal surveillance, as we have seen in Poland”, say S&D members Katarina Barley and Lukasz Kohut. Both MEPs travelled to Warsaw with the European Parliament’s spyware inquiry committee, PEGA*, for a fact-finding mission, and heard from experts, judges, journalists, local politicians, and persons targeted by Pegasus spyware.

The auditors of the Polish Supreme Audit Office confirmed that Poland’s Central Anti-Corruption Bureau, the CBA, illegally bought Pegasus in 2017 using Ministry of Justice funds meant for victims of crimes. It is impossible to know exactly how many people have been targeted so far, as the Polish government refuses to share any information on this, even to the victims themselves. In none of the cases that have become public were the victims criminally charged. Their surveillance was purely politically motivated, targeting mainly political opponents of PiS, the ruling party, or government critics, activists and independent lawyers.

The Polish government has refused to meet the members of the European Parliament’s PEGA delegation.

Katarina Barley, S&D MEP and vice-president of the European Parliament said:

“What we have heard in Warsaw is shocking. Pegasus was illegally bought and used for political purposes, while there is practically no control of the security services. Nobody can feel safe under these circumstances.

The demolition of the proper checks and balances in Poland, during years of the PiS government undermining democracy and the rule of law, makes the Polish case particularly worrying.

“Spying on political opponents is Putin’s way of acting and it’s unacceptable in the EU.

“The current Polish government refuses to investigate and clear up this scandal. That is why Polish citizens count on Europe to protect their privacy and freedoms. We need stronger European legislation regarding spyware technologies that will shield all European citizens, including the Polish, from the abusive use of spyware. We must make sure that such technologies are only used as the last resort in the most serious crimes, with very strict safeguards”.

Lukasz Kohut, S&D MEP and member of the PEGA inquiry committee added:

“It is a scandal that in the twenty-first century in Poland, in the European Union, the authorities used this anti-terrorist cyber weapon to brutally enter into the private lives of their political opponents and citizens. This is an authoritarian state method, where authorities are capable of anything, justifying their actions by hiding behind ‘national security’. That is why our inquiry committee, PEGA, is so important. We will do our best to clear this scandal up completely. Europe must put all the pressure it has on the Polish authorities to make them stop spying on innocent citizens”.

Note to editors:

The European Parliament established the Parliament’s committee of inquiry to investigate the use of the Pegasus and equivalent surveillance spyware (PEGA) last year to investigate alleged breaches of EU law in the use of the surveillance software in EU. Pegasus and equivalent spyware enable the attacker to turn a smartphone into a surveillance device.

Post by RK Online Desk on Wednesday, September 21, 2022

Following a complaint lodged by All Terrain Vehicle (ATV) Association-Gulmarg against an authorized dealer of an Importer-Company for selling spare-parts without complying with the rules, Legal Metrology Department (LMD) penalized the company on establishing violation of rules.

The Divisional Commissioner, Kashmir, Pandurang K. Pole who has been very prompt in resolving the public grievances, had referred the said complaint to the Legal Metrology Department for immediate action and report.

The Legal Metrology Department in turn vehemently raided the premises of sale and service centre of the authorized dealer at Tangmarg.

During the surprise inspection, a good number of imported spare-parts were found without Maximum Retail Price and other mandatory declarations like month and year of import, customer-care details and address of Importer etc.

A challan was made out against the Importer-Company and six products were seized on spot as evidence for being without proper labeling.

Under Legal Metrology laws, every imported-packaged item shall carry on the label the Maximum Retail Price, country of origin, Month & Year of Import, address of the Importer with e-mail address and contact number etc.

EUR/USD Slides to 0.99 as Putin Declares Partial Mobilization

The EUR/USD pair has come under increasing pressure amid the recent menacing national address by Russian President Vladimir Putin and the speculation on the upcoming rate hike by the US Federal Reserve. As of now, the EUR is down by around 0.68% to $0.9903 against the US dollar.

Putin Announces Partial Mobilization, Energy Prices Spike

On Wednesday, Putin announced Russia’s first mobilization since World War Two, calling up 300,000 fighters for the war in Ukraine. He also voiced support for a plan to annex swathes of Ukraine, while warning the West that he is ready to use nuclear weapons to defend Russia.

According to a report by Reuters, Putin explicitly warned about his readiness to use nuclear weapons in the biggest escalation of the war since Moscow’s invasion of its neighbor on February 24. He reportedly said during a televised address to the nation:

“If the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we will, without doubt, use all available means to protect Russia and our people – this is not a bluff.”

The announcement comes as Russian forces have suffered heavy battlefield defeats in northeastern Ukraine. The country’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said that Russia would recruit 300,000 fighters out of approximately 25 million potential fighters at Moscow’s disposal.

Following the announcement, almost all crude oil blends and indexes spiked. West Texas Crude (WTI) increased by 2.64% reaching $86.16 per barrel, UK’s Brent Crude spiked by 2.52% to around $93, and UAE’s Murban Crude surged by 1.87% to just over $94, according to data by Oil Price.

Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at UBS Group, confirmed that the recent spike in oil prices is due to increasing concerns about upcoming supply disruptions. “Supply disruption concerns are supporting oil,” he reportedly said.

Rising Inflation and Upcoming Rate Hike

As reported, inflation eased to 8.3% in August. While the figure came lower than July’s 8.5%, it still exceeded the Wall Street expectations of around 8% on an annual basis. This led to speculations that the Fed might impose a third consecutive 75 bps interest rate increase or even its first 100 bps rate hike.

Meanwhile, the lack of economic data by the European Central Bank (ECB) has further forced the markets to focus on the Fed decisions. According to the ECB’s weekly schedule of public speaking, no ECB members will be speaking ahead of the Fed.

As of now, today’s FOMC policy decision is the primary reference for the market’s direction. In the case of a dovish 75-basis point rate hike, the EUR would likely test the Second Major Resistance Level (R2) at $1.0087 and resistance at $1.0100, according to FXEmpire analysts.

According to the FedWatch Tool, there is an 82% probability of a 75-basis point rate versus 18% for a percentage point move. Notably, the probability of a percentage point move was around 16% earlier today, suggesting that the Fed might take into account Russia’s latest threat.

Nevertheless, the scales remain tipped in favor of the dollar for now. According to data by Bloomberg, the EUR is down by around 0.68% to $0.9903 against the US dollar.

Randy Orton will take the stand in the trial for the lawsuit over his tattoos being featured in the WWE 2K franchise. As reported last week, the long-delayed trial is set to start next week and PWInsider reports that Orton is scheduled as a witness in the trial.

Tattoo artist Catherine Alexander filed the suit against WWE, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc., 2K Games, Inc., 2K Sports, Inc., Visual Concepts Entertainment, Yuke’s Co., Ltd. and Yuke’s LA Inc. back in April of 2018. Alexander alleges that she owns all the original designs for her work on Orton. The lawsuit states that she never gave the defendants permission to recreate them in the video games and thus they are infringing on her copyrights.

The trial, which has been postponed several times over the past few years for various reasons, is set to start on September 26th in the U.S. District Court Southern District of Illinois. A judge ruled in September of 2020 that WWE and Take-Two had copied five of Alexander’s original designs that she holds valid trademarks on but denied a summary judgment for Alexander, sending the case toward a jury trial.","P|##WI|##ns|##ider|WWE|Take|-|Two|Interactive|Software|,|Inc|2|##K|Games|,|Inc|2|##K|Sports|,|Inc|Visual|Concept|##s|Entertainment|Yu|##ke|’|s|Co|.|,|Ltd|Yu|##ke|’|LA|Inc|U|District|Court|Southern|District|Illinois|WWE|Take|-|Two|"
26,"Philadelphia, residents file separate lawsuits against owners of building that partially collapsed
""These people need to make it right. This is wrong,"" one resident said.

The City of Philadelphia and residents have filed separate lawsuits against the owners of the Lindley Towers in Logan.

PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- The City of Philadelphia filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the owners of the Lindley Towers in the Logan section of the city.

The owners are expected in court at 10 a.m. Thursday.

But that is not the only lawsuit facing the building's management.

A second lawsuit was filed Wednesday. It has been posted on the fence outside the building.

Nearly two dozen residents are suing to get their rent money back and compensation on behalf of the roughly 100 people who live in the building on Camac Street and Lindley Avenue.

""SBG Management is not giving anyone their security deposits back or their rent back,"" displaced tenant Rosa Abraham said. ""My kids haven't been to school in a week because they are homeschooled and all the bouncing and instability is causing them problems with not being able to go to school.""

The lawsuits come after part of the facade on the 7th floor collapsed last Wednesday, forcing an evacuation of the building.

According to the city's lawsuit, the building is ""imminently dangerous and uninhabitable."" It also says the management didn't have a valid rental license because it expired in February of 2021. The city is seeking at least $1.5 million.

SEE ALSO: Crews respond to partial collapse at apartment building in city's Logan section

""Why is it that they aren't putting us in housing?"" Tamika Dover asked. She was one of the dozens forced out of the building last week. She's been living in shelters ever since.

""Why are they not refunding our money?"" she said.

Engineers were back out at the building on Wednesday inspecting a gaping hole in the side of the building where the facade collapsed.

They were hired by the owners of the building to look for other structural issues. According to the city's lawsuit, the collapse was caused by the owners' failure to remediate violations of the Philadelphia code. Action News found nearly 200 violations against the property.

We tried talking with a representative with SBG Management on site, but he could not comment.

""These people need to make it right. This is wrong,"" said Dover.

She said the owners offered to give her 28 days in a hotel room in exchange for signing a waiver. She would not accept the offer.

Abraham is also waiting for a permanent home with her two kids and a woman she cares for. They left the Red Cross shelter set up at Samuel Fels High School gym after it closed Tuesday night.

They are staying in another shelter run by the city for the time being.

""My kids are an emotional wreck,"" Abraham said. ""This will damage them.""",City|of|Philadelphia|Lin|##dley|Towers|P|##H|##IL|##AD|##EL|##P|##H|City|of|Philadelphia|Lin|Towers|S|##B|##G|Management|Engineers|Philadelphia|Action|News|S|Dover|

29,"Hawthorn allegations: Chris Fagan issues statement as ex-Hawks staffer Jason Burt stands down from Caulfield Grammar
Brisbane coach Chris Fagan has denied claims surrounding his involvement in Hawthorn’s alleged mistreatment of First Nations AFL players and their families.

The 61-year-old’s future is under a cloud ahead of an independent investigation into accusations made in a review commissioned by the Hawks and subsequent ABC interviews with former players and their partners.

Fagan, who agreed to stand down from his role at Brisbane on Wednesday, worked at Hawthorn from 2008 to 2016.

“I was shocked and deeply distressed by the allegations reported in the media yesterday concerning my time at the Hawthorn Football Club,” Fagan said in a statement on Thursday.

“I deny, categorically, the allegations of wrongdoing by me in relation to First Nations players at the Hawthorn Football Club.

“I have had very positive relationships with First Nations players throughout my many years in football, and, indeed players from different racial and ethnic groups.”

Fagan confirmed he was not involved in the Hawthorn review but did not directly address the ABC report, which said Fagan, Clarkson and Burt did not respond to detailed questions put to them.

“I had no opportunity to, and did not, participate in any way in the review commissioned by the Hawthorn Football Club,” he said.

“I was not interviewed. Nor was I invited to be interviewed. No one associated with the review ever put any allegation to me for a response.

“I intend to defend myself. It is my hope that people will judge me based upon the way I actually conduct myself and not by what is written in the media.

“I support and welcome the investigation announced by the AFL yesterday. I intend to participate fully in the investigation and look forward to being heard and being accorded due process and fairness.”

The AFL is set to appoint a four-person panel, led by a King’s Counsel, to probe the claims.

Fagan’s former colleague Alastair Clarkson issued a similar statement on Wednesday after he stepped back from working with North Melbourne pending the findings of the investigation.

Fagan was a senior assistant coach to Clarkson and general manager of football at the Hawks during their premiership years before being appointed Brisbane coach in 2017.

Earlier on Thursday, it emerged that Jason Burt - a former Hawthorn football staffer named in the reports - has stood aside from his coaching and performance role at Caulfield Grammar in Melbourne.

The school’s principal Ashleigh Martin said Burt had taken an indefinite leave of absence.

“Jason is a former employee of Hawthorn, and his desire to engage fully in the investigation, therefore requiring (sic) leave from our school,” Martin said in an email to parents.

“As you would appreciate, the matters pertaining to the AFL’s independent investigation are highly sensitive for all parties involved.

“We are providing Jason with appropriate support while the investigation takes place.”

30,"Optus cyber attack: Massive data breach affects millions of customers’ personal information
Optus has suffered a major data breach, compromising the personal information of up to nine million Australian customers.

Personal details, including passport and licence numbers, email and home addresses, dates of birth and telephone numbers of 2.8 million customers were accessed in the cyberattack, Optus has confirmed.

Watch the latest News on Channel 7 or stream for free on 7plus >>

About seven million people’s dates of birth, email addresses and phone numbers were stolen.

Cyber criminals could have access to enough information to steal the identities of millions of Optus customers, the consumer watchdog has warned.

Australian Consumer and Competition Commission deputy chair Delia Rickard said the cyberattack was extremely worrying due to the large amount of personal information fraudsters might be able to access.

“These are all the things that you need for identity theft and also all the things you need to personalise a scam and make it much more convincing,” she told Nine on Friday.

Optus Australia confirmed the attack on Thursday, stating it was “investigating the possible unauthorised access of current and former customers’ information”.

“We are devastated to discover that we have been subject to a cyberattack that has resulted in the disclosure of our customers’ personal information to someone who shouldn’t see it,” Optus CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin said.

“As soon as we knew, we took action to block the attack and began an immediate investigation.

“While not everyone may be affected and our investigation is not yet complete, we want all of our customers to be aware of what has happened as soon as possible so that they can increase their vigilance.”

Optus assured payment details and account passwords have not been compromised and Optus services, including mobile and home internet, are not affected.

“Optus has also notified key financial institutions about this matter,” Rosmarin said.

“While we are not aware of customers having suffered any harm, we encourage customers to have heightened awareness across their accounts, including looking out for unusual or fraudulent activity and any notifications which seem odd or suspicious.

“We are very sorry and understand customers will be concerned. Please be assured that we are working hard ... to help safeguard our customers as much as possible.”

Cybersecurity Minister Clare O’Neil told 7NEWS.com.au: “The Australian Cybersecurity Centre is providing cybersecurity advice and technical assistance” in relation to the cyberattack involving Optus.

Australian Federal Police, the Office of the Australian Information Regulator and other key regulators have also been notified.

Optus responds

In an update on Friday, Rosmarin described the attack as “sophisticated”.

“We are taking full accountability for what has happened,” she said.

“No ransomware demands have been made ... but it’s too early to rule out any possibilities.”

Rosmarin said Optus will be contacting all customers.

“In the next few days, all customers will be contacted ... including those who have not been affected, and they will know what category they will fall into,” she said.

While it is estimated up to 9.8 million people may have been affected, Rosmarin described this number as a “worst case scenario”.

“We have reason to believe that number is actually much lower,” she said.

“Once we’ve worked through all the relevant information, we expect that number will be much lower.

“But again, our teams are looking into every possibility.”

Rosmarin said the message to Optus customers is to remain alert.

“What customers can do is be vigilant, if anything unusual occurs report it … be alert to any activity that seems suspicious or odd,” she said.

Rosmarin said, given the matter is “subject to criminal proceedings”, the company would not release any further details about how the attack unfolded.

What you can do

Scamwatch advised Optus customers to secure their personal information by changing online account passwords and enabling multi-factor authentication for banking.

Affected customers should also place limits on bank accounts, monitor for any unusual activity and request a ban on credit reports if any fraud is suspected.

Laws questioned after Optus cyberattack

The cyberattack is a dramatic wake-up call and should lead to tougher privacy and data laws, the federal opposition says.

While the government has initiated a review into data security on social media platforms such as TikTok, it won’t be completed until next year, opposition communications spokeswoman Senator Sarah Henderson said.

“This is all too little, too late,” she said.

“Rather than kick the can down the road, Labor must urgently consider all regulatory options and act immediately to improve the privacy and safety of Australians online.”

Henderson said the opposition had for months been calling on the Albanese government to deliver tougher online privacy and data protection laws.

In July, it called on Labor to adopt the coalition’s Online Privacy Bill and, earlier this month, she and other opposition MPs had criticised the government for failing to strengthen laws.

The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner said it would engage with Optus to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Notifiable Data Breaches scheme.

Under the framework, organisations covered by the Privacy Act must notify affected individuals as quickly as possible if they experience a data breach likely to result in serious harm.

32,"App Tracking Transparency workaround sees Meta face class action lawsuit
Meta is facing a class action lawsuit after both Facebook and Instagram were found to be using an App Tracking Transparency workaround to track users on the web, even after they were denied permission to do so.

The company is accused not just of breaking Apple’s privacy rules, but also violating both state and federal laws …

Background

App Tracking works by Apple assigning a unique identifier to your device. It doesn’t reveal any details about you, but does allow them to see (for example) that iOS user 30255BCE-4CDA-4F62-91DC-4758FDFF8512 has visited gadget websites, and therefore would be a good target for gadget ads.

It also allows them to see that iOS user 30255BCE-4CDA-4F62-91DC-4758FDFF8512 was shown an ad for a particular product on a particular website, then subsequently went to a particular retailer site to buy it – therefore that ad was (likely) successful.

With App Tracking Transparency, app developers must ask you if you want to allow that tracking. If you say no (as most people do), then the apps are not allowed to use that system.

Meta’s App Tracking Transparency workaround

Facebook and Instagram each have their own embedded web browsers, which are used whenever a user taps a link in either app. This means that Meta can track activity in those browsers.

The theoretical risk of this was already well understood, but security researcher Felix Krause last month found concrete evidence that Meta was actually doing this.

He found that both apps injected their tracking code into every website shown, including when clicking on ads. In the most extreme case, this would enable Meta to monitor all user interactions, like every button & link tapped, text selections, screenshots, as well as any form inputs, like passwords, addresses, and credit card numbers.

Krause doesn’t suggest Meta is going that far, of course. His research didn’t allow him to see what data the company was extracting, but he was able to confirm that they do extract something.

I don’t have a list of precise data Instagram sends back home. I do have proof that the Instagram and Facebook app actively run JavaScript commands to inject an additional JS SDK without the user’s consent, as well as tracking the user’s text selections. If Instagram is doing this already, they could also inject any other JS code.

Class action lawsuit

Bloomberg reports that two users have now sued Meta in a proposed class action lawsuit.

Meta Platforms Inc. was sued for allegedly building a secret work-around to safeguards that Apple Inc. launched last year to protect iPhone users from having their internet activity tracked. In a proposed class-action complaint filed Wednesday in San Francisco federal court, two Facebook users accused the company of skirting Apple’s 2021 privacy rules and violating state and federal laws limiting the unauthorized collection of personal data. A similar complaint was filed in the same court last week […] Responding to the report, Meta acknowledged that the Facebook app monitors browser activity, but denied it was illegally collecting user data.

A Meta spokesperson told us: “These allegations are without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously. We have designed our in-app browser to respect users’ privacy choices, including how data may be used for ads.”

A class action suit is when others affected are invited to join the action against the defendant. Generally this means no more than filling in an online form if the case is successful, and compensation awarded (which is generally just a few dollars per person). A judge has to approve the conversion of the lawsuit to a class action.

33,"Lawyers want venue changed for man accused of stabbing pregnant wife to death in 2019
Lawyers want venue changed for man accused of stabbing pregnant wife to death in 2019

Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg took the stand to argue the accused killer's request to change venue for his trial.

PASADENA, Texas (KTRK) -- A change of venue is being considered for a murder suspect accused of killing his pregnant wife while out on bond for a different crime.

ORGINAL REPORT: Man targets unborn child during deadly stabbing of pregnant wife, prosecutors say

The murder dates back to 2019, and it involves Alex Guajardo and his wife, Caitlynne, whom he is accused of stabbing to death.

Guajardo's attorney said publicity in the case prevents his client from getting a fair trial.

Guajardo was out of jail on a personal recognizance bond after allegedly hitting Caitlynne at the time of her alleged murder.

In the courtroom on Wednesday, Guajardo's defense attorney, Justin Keiter, first called to the stand Dane Schiller, the Harris County District Attorney's director of communications. Schiller was on the stand for about four hours and was asked many questions by Keiter about how much media coverage this particular case received and what his office had to do with encouraging journalists to report on it.

At one point, Keiter asked if it was fair to say the DA's office used Guajardo as a ""poster child"" for bail reform. Schiller said no.

During the questioning, Keiter asked and Schiller admitted to commenting on news stories online anonymously using the username ""DudeGoggles."" In a Houston Chronicle story about the mother of the complainant in this case suing Harris County over cashless released from jail, he commented, ""We have to ask ourselves, what the heck are some of these judges thinking these days?"" He did not identify himself as an employee of the District Attorney's office in the comment.

District Attorney Kim Ogg was called to the stand at about 3 p.m. She was asked many questions about her influence, her job, and her emails. The hearing ended before the prosecutor questioned Ogg.

While Keiter argued there was extensive media coverage of Guajardo, the prosecutor argued there were nine stories in the first year after the alleged murder happened and that none of them had his name in the headline, therefore she does not think the potential jury pool was influenced.

RELATED: Man accused of murdering his pregnant wife days after domestic abuse allegation

Caitlynne's mother did her best to keep the details in the public eye in hopes of changing the way bonds are given to suspects.

Caitlynne's Law made its way to the state legislature, but it did not pass. However, parts of it were rolled into Senate Bill 6, which did pass.

Defense attorneys said Ogg and Schiller were outspoken in their condemnation of the bond system that allowed Guajardo to get out of jail before he allegedly stabbed his wife to death.

53-year-old man going to prison for possessing, receiving child porn in 2016, officials say

GALVESTON, Texas (KTRK) -- A 53-year-old Galveston man is going to prison following his child porn conviction, according to U.S. Attorney Jennifer B. Lowery.

The video above is ABC13's 24/7 livestream.

Cedric Robert Cox pleaded guilty on July 21, 2021 to receiving and possessing child pornography.

On Tuesday, Cox was sentenced for each of the receiving and possessing convictions, respectively, which will run concurrently for an 84-month term of imprisonment in total.

Cox was also ordered to pay $9,000 in restitution to the victims and will serve 10 years on supervised release following completion of his prison term, officials said.

Officials said that during that time, he will have to comply with several requirements that will restrict his access to children and the internet and will also be ordered to register as a sex offender.

In 2016, authorities said they discovered Cox using peer-to-peer file sharing software to obtain child pornography and seized many devices after executing a search warrant at his home.

According to authorities, further examination revealed the devices contained 32 images and 62 videos containing child pornography, as well as search terms that indicated his sexual interest in children.

Cox was reportedly allowed to remain on bond and voluntarily surrender to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future.",##L|K|##TR|##K|ABC|##13|U|S|Bureau|of|Prison|##s|

Man shot to death in his sleep in what HPD calls random act of violence in southwest Houston

Police are investigating what they're calling a random act of violence after a homeless man was shot and killed in his sleep in southwest Houston.

HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- Police are investigating what they're calling a random act of violence after a homeless man was shot and killed in his sleep in southwest Houston.

At about 11:45 a.m. Wednesday, police received a call of a person down behind a business in the 3800 block of Fondren Road, near Westpark Drive. Officers said a passerby was walking and saw a homeless man who appeared to be passed out and in need of medical attention.

When the fire department arrived at the scene, they found bullet casings and saw the man was shot in the head.

Sgt. Michael Cass with HPD's Homicide Division said they saw surveillance video from a nearby business, showing a young man walking up to the victim at about midnight and shooting him in the head.

The suspect is then seen running southbound toward Westpark.

The suspect was described as a young man wearing light-colored sweatpants, a dark sweatshirt with a hoodie pulled up, white tennis shoes, and a black backpack.

The suspect was also seen hanging around the area for a few minutes before the victim was killed, police said.

The victim's identity was not immediately released.

At this time, the motive behind the shooting is unknown, but police believe it was a random act of violence.",HP|##D|HP|##D|Police|##US|##N|K|##TR|##K|HP|##D|Ho|##mic|##ide|Division|

La Porte ISD employee caught on camera berating high school student

The teenager is seen backing up several steps as the school employee moves closer and, at one point, appears to be within inches of the student's face.

LA PORTE, Texas (KTRK) -- School administrators said an investigation is underway after an employee was caught on camera berating a teenage student.

An anonymous viewer shared the video with Eyewitness News, saying it was caught on camera Tuesday at La Porte High School after school dismissal.

In the video, the school employee is heard spewing profanity and yelling in the teen's face while shaking a finger.

The teen is seen backing up several steps as the employee moves closer and, at one point, appears to be within inches of the student's face saying, ""You're not going to talk to me like that! Ever!""

The video circulating among students in La Porte has one mother, who asked to remain anonymous, concerned.

""Just by seeing that video, if he can do that, who's not to say he can't be violent toward a student? So, that's my concern,"" she said.

ABC13 spoke with the employee over the phone on Wednesday, but he declined to comment on the behavior.

La Porte ISD released a statement saying:

The safety and security of our students are of utmost importance, and La Porte ISD does not tolerate the bullying, verbal or physical abuse of any child. We are aware of a video that has been circulating that appears to show one of our employees reprimanding a student using inappropriate language. We have launched an investigation, and our administration will address this concern according to district policy.

We asked La Porte ISD if the employee was back at work on Wednesday and if the student was touched or harmed at any point.

The district has not responded to our additional questions.

""Talking to the student that way, I think (the school employee) should be disciplined. That's my opinion. There's no need to let it go that far,"" the anonymous mother said.

The La Porte Police Department said they are not working a case and have not been asked to assist the school district with their investigation.

38,"Employees strike due to 'poor working conditions' at Fresno County Sunnyside Convalescent Hospital
Staff members say they staged a one-day walkout and strike to bring attention to poor working conditions at the nursing home.

Dozens of workers lined Peach Avenue near North Avenue outside of the Sunnyside Convalescent Hospital Wednesday.

FRESNO, Calif. (KFSN) -- Dozens of workers lined Peach Avenue near North Avenue outside of the Sunnyside Convalescent Hospital Wednesday.

Staff members say they staged a one-day walkout and strike to bring attention to poor working conditions at the nursing home.

""We can't take it anymore. We just can't. We need safe staffing for the residents. That's who we're here for, for them,"" said Sylvia Gomez, a housekeeper who has worked at the facility for eight years.

She says if it were her parents being cared for at the facility, she'd want better for them.

In addition to low staffing, she said she and other workers have had to deal with bounced paychecks.

""Every time we get paid we're nervous to see, is our check going to go through,"" Gomez said.

Maria Xiquin is the regional director of SEIU 2015, the union representing the nursing home workers.

She says there has been a 75% drop in staff in the last year and a half.

The union has been in contract negotiations since February and say they're eager for the owner, Mario Marasigan, to present a proposal, but so far he hasn't.

""Again, for us, a strike is the last thing we want to do, especially in nursing homes, but at this point, it's not just our members who don't have a paycheck, it's also patients who are not getting quality care,"" Xiquin said.

Action News spoke with Marasigan over the phone Wednesday morning.

He agreed to answer question via email, but, so far, we have not heard back.

This afternoon union workers alongside, City Councilmember Luis Chavez and councilmember-elect Annalisa Perea, walked in a letter to the facility.

It notified management that if a tentative contract isn't in place in 10 business days, workers will strike indefinitely starting October 6.

Fresno County Sheriff's Deputies showed up a few minutes later.

""I think there was a little bit of hostility, initially, just because the folks who were coming in, but I spoke to them, I told them what it was. It just a deliverance with the terms of a contract. Once that happened, they were OK with it and we exited the facility,"" Chavez said.

This isn't the first time this nursing home has made headlines.

In 2008, workers went on strike under previous owner Michael Fellen because nursing staff said they were not getting paid.

Then in 2017, Fellen was convicted of stealing around $20,000 from patient trust funds. He was sentenced to three years of probation.",Con|##scent|##FS|##N|SE|##I|##U|2015|Action|News|City|Council|Luis|Anna|Fresno|County|Sheriff|

25 indicted for PPP loan fraud in Will County; some filed while in jail

Joliet police and federal authorities announced that 25 people have been indicted for allegedly defrauding the federal Paycheck Protection Program.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- Joliet police and federal authorities announced that 25 people have been indicted for allegedly defrauding the federal Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, which helped struggling businesses during the pandemic.

Authorities said the alleged offenders obtained loans in the range of $20,000. Many simply wrote down names of fake businesses on their applications.

""These Triple P loans that, if they're obtained fraudulently, they're taking that money out of the businesses in our local area that actually need them,"" said R. Sean Fitzgerald, acting special agent in charge of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for the Greater Chicago Area.

The investigation, dubbed ""Operation Triple P,"" targeted people arrested for felony weapons offenses who had also applied for unemployment benefits. The investigation was then able to identify those suspected of defrauding PPP.

""Getting their application, and part of the prerequisites was they cannot have an open felony indictment, which is how came up with our list of candidates,"" said Joliet Detective James Kilgore.

Police said some of the alleged fraudsters were already in custody, and used phones at the jail to call to complete the fraudulent applications.

""Some of the targets bonded out on their felony cases days after receiving their fraudulent PPP loan,"" said Joliet Police Chief William Evans.

Police said of the 25 indicted individuals, 15 have been arrested and 10 more are still being sought.

""Without holding offenders accountable, history has proven that bad actors will shamelessly defraud the government and taxpayers in the name of greed,"" Fitzgerald said.

PPP loan fraud is hardly unique to Will County. It's happening nationwide, and the federal government is currently working to recoup billions of dollars in fraudulent payouts.",##lie|Pay|##che|##ck|Protection|Program|##IC|##AG|##O|##LS|P|U|.|S|.|Department|of|Homeland|Security|Jo|##lie|##t|Police|Fitzgerald|

49-year-old man found dead inside Carson business was apparently stabbed, authorities say

An investigation is underway after a man was found dead inside a business in Carson early Tuesday morning, according to authorities.

CARSON, Calif. (KABC) -- A homicide investigation is underway after a man was found dead inside a business in Carson, according to the authorities.

The man, identified as 49-year-old Xiaoyi Wang, sustained apparent stab wounds, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. He was found inside the business located in the 1700 block of E. Del Amo Boulevard on Tuesday.

The sheriff's department told Eyewitness News an employee found the man when he got to work at around 6:15 a.m. Investigators believe the victim may be either a worker or possibly one of the owners of the business.

""We know the victim worked late into the night so at some point, during the night, some kind of incident occurred here,"" said LASD Lt. Derrick Alfred, who added the victim had serious injuries to his body and head.

The employee who found him reported seeing the victim's personal belongings nearby.

Authorities didn't provide detailed information regarding the business itself. Alfred believes the facility is part of some sort of importing business.

Investigators do not believe the incident was gang-related, and a motive or information on a possible suspect was not available.

New York Attorney General Letitia James files $250M lawsuit against Trump, family alleging fraud

New York Attorney General Letitia James sued former President Donald Trump and his company for fraud, alleging they padded his net worth by billions. Lauren Glassberg has the story

NEW YORK CITY (WABC) -- For 20 years, Donald Trump and his family enriched themselves through ""numerous acts of fraud and misrepresentations,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James alleged in a new lawsuit that accused the Trumps of ""grossly"" inflating the former president's net worth by billions of dollars, cheating lenders and others with false and misleading financial statements.

The civil lawsuit, filed Wednesday in the state Supreme Court in Manhattan, alleges the former president's golf resort and now home, Mar-A-Lago, was valued as high as $779 million but should have been valued at $75 million.

The suit says that higher valuation was ""based on the false premise that it was unrestricted property and could be developed for residential use even though Mr. Trump himself signed deeds donating his residential development rights and sharply restricting changes to the property.""

The lawsuit seeks a $250 million judgment and a prohibition on any of the Trumps from leading a company in the state of New York.

James is also referring her findings to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, who could open a criminal investigation into bank fraud, according to a footnote in the lawsuit.

Through ""persistent and repeated business fraud,"" the Trumps convinced banks to lend money to the Trump Organization on more favorable terms than deserved, according to the lawsuit, which named the former president, three of his adult children, the company, and two of its executives, Allan Weisselberg and Jeff McConney.

""Mr. Trump made known through Mr. Weisselberg that he wanted his net worth on the statements to increase -- a desire Mr. Weisselberg and others carried out year after year in their fraudulent preparation of the Statements,"" the lawsuit said. ""The scheme to inflate Mr. Trump's net worth also remained consistent year after year.""

Weisselberg has pleaded guilty to tax charges brought by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, which has been conducting a parallel investigation.

Trump has denied wrongdoing and has called the investigation a politically motivated ""witch-hunt"" by an attorney general he called ""racist."" James, who is Black, rejected a settlement offer from the Trump Organization last month to resolve the matter, sources told ABC News.

The attorney general's investigation began in March 2019, after Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, testified before Congress that Trump's annual financial statements inflated the values of Trump's assets to obtain favorable terms for loans and insurance coverage, while also deflating the value of other assets to reduce real estate taxes.

A 2012 statement valued rent-stabilized apartments in Trump Park Avenue as if they could be rented at market value. As a result, units collectively worth $750,000 were valued at nearly $50 million, according to the lawsuit.

""The magnitude of financial benefit derived by Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization by means of these fraudulent and misleading submissions was considerable,"" the lawsuit said.

Trump Turnberry, a golf club in Scotland, was valued at nearly $127 million, but the lawsuit said that since it opened in 2017, the golf course has operated at a loss each year.

""As a result using valued for the golf course ranging between $123 million and $126.8 million based on employing the Fixed Asset Scheme is materially false and misleading,"" the attorney general's suit said. ""The golf course should have been valued at a much lower figure.""

Trump's attorney, Alina Habba, released a statement in response to the lawsuit:

""Today's filing is neither focused on the facts nor the law - rather, it is solely focused on advancing the Attorney General's political agenda,"" the statement said. ""It is abundantly clear that the Attorney General's Office has exceeded its statutory authority by prying into transactions where absolutely no wrongdoing has taken place. We are confident that our judicial system will not stand for this unchecked abuse of authority, and we look forward to defending our client against each and every one of the Attorney General's meritless claims.""

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg issued the following statement after James said her investigation revealed alleged conduct that she believes violated criminal law:

""Our criminal investigation concerning former President Donald J. Trump, the Trump Organization, and its leadership is active and ongoing,"" it said.

Police searching for boyfriend of 22-year-old woman who was found in 2 suitcases at Brooklyn home

Investigators believe a body found stuffed into two suitcases in an apartment in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn is that of a 22-year-old woman. Chantee Lans has the story.

CYPRESS HILLS, Brooklyn (WABC) -- The body of a 22-year-old woman was found stuffed into two suitcases in an apartment in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn.

Residents of the building reported a foul smell and told security the woman, D'Asia Johnson, had not been seen for several days.

A security guard went to her 6th-floor apartment and attempted to enter but was stopped by the woman's 23-year-old boyfriend, who allegedly lived in the apartment sometimes.

The guard went back downstairs to call the police and saw the boyfriend and another man sneak out with a suspected bag of evidence.

That's when the guard went back upstairs to the apartment and discovered the two suitcases with the woman's remains in a bloody bathroom. He also found a meat cleaver in the apartment.

Police said Johnson had a valid order of protection against her boyfriend until the end of the month.

Friends say the victim was a sweet and humble person, and a neighbor remembered her as a young girl who had not yet lived.

Detectives are now actively looking for the boyfriend, who they say violated the order of protection in the past showing up at her apartment unannounced.

Friends say she moved in two years ago when the affordable housing building first opened.

Neighbors said they heard fighting two weeks ago.

""This neighborhood is not the best neighborhood, to be honest with you, but this is outrageous, absolutely outrageous,"" neighbor Lindsey Vena said. ""It makes me scared to even be around here. I'm just sick.""

Other residents expressed shock and disbelief over the gruesome discovery.

""This is scary,"" another resident said. ""I live here with my family, and it's just kind of wicked knowing that there's somebody doing something like this where you lay your head at night.""

The medical examiner determined the death to be caused by multiple stab wounds and deemed it a homicide.

The investigation remains active and ongoing.

43,"Trump PAC payments to law firm fighting New York probe top $1 million
Trump's PACs have paid over $1 million to the firm of attorney Alina Habba.

Former President Donald Trump's political action committees have paid over a million dollars to the firm of the attorney representing him in connection with the investigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James, which on Wednesday resulted in a sweeping, multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Trump and his family real estate business following years of probing.

Together, two of Trump's PACs -- Save America and Make America Great Again PAC -- have paid $1.01 million to the firm of New Jersey-based attorney Alina Habba, according to new campaign disclosure filings.

The first payment to Habba's firm occurred in February 2022, when Trump's campaign committee-turned-PAC paid the firm $10,000.

The payments then quickly accelerated. Trump's leadership PAC, Save America, has paid a total of $943,000 to the firm since April -- including $207,827 in August alone.

Wednesday's lawsuit by the New York AG accuses Trump and his family of enriching themselves through ""numerous acts of fraud and misrepresentations,"" claiming they ""grossly"" inflated the former president's net worth by billions of dollars and cheated lenders and others with false and misleading financial statements.

The civil lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, seeks a $250 million judgment and a prohibition on any of the Trumps leading a company in the state of New York.

The payments come as the multiple investigations into the former president continue. Trump is also currently facing criminal investigations in New York, Georgia, and Washington, D.C.

Save America's total monthly spending skyrocketed in August, according to disclosure reports, with its legal spending nearly doubling since the PAC first launched in 2020. Since then, the PAC has spent nearly $7 million on legal fees.

Habba, a relative newcomer to Trump's legal team, represents him in a number of cases and lawsuits in addition to her work in connection with the New York AG's probe. Previously, she was Trump's lawyer in the now-withdrawn defamation case brought by former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos, who had claimed Trump groped her in Beverly Hills and then defamed her when he denied it during the 2016 presidential campaign.

Trump has denied wrongdoing in both cases. A representative for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News, nor did Habba.

Last fall, Habba said in an interview with the Washington Post that she had never worked with Trump before the Zervos case, which she joined in September 2021.

""I just stepped in,"" Habba told the Post. ""We're hoping to have some traction and clear the president's name.""

Last month, Trump hired a new lawyer, Chris Kise, to represent him in the criminal probe that led to the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago in August. Save America PAC paid Kise's firm $3 million to cover his work, according to a report from Politico.

In its latest disclosure filing, Save America reported paying another law firm, Critton, Luttier & Coleman LLP, $3 million in August, the single biggest legal expenditure the PAC has reported.",Trump|PA|##C|PA|Save|America|##C|PA|##C|PA|##C|Save|America|New|York|AG|State|Supreme|Court|Save|America|PA|##C|PA|##C|Ali|Supreme|New|Crane|Newman|New|Daily|News|Images|##IL|Ha|
44,"An Independent Due Diligence Exercise into Meta’s Human Rights Impact in Israel and Palestine During the May 2021 Escalation
We want our services to be a place where people can express themselves freely and safely around the world. This is especially true in situations where social media can be used to spread hate, fuel tension and incite violence on the ground. That’s why we have clear rules against terrorism, hate speech and incitement to violence, and subject matter experts who help develop and enforce those rules. We also have a corporate Human Rights policy and a dedicated Human Rights team — who help us manage human rights risks and better understand how our products and technologies impact different countries and communities.

As part of our commitment to help create an environment where people can express themselves freely and safely, and following a recommendation from the Oversight Board in September 2021, we asked Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) — an independent organization with expertise in human rights — to conduct a due diligence exercise into the impact of our policies and processes in Israel and Palestine during the May 2021 escalation, including an examination of whether these policies and processes were applied without bias. Over the course of the last year, BSR conducted a detailed analysis, including engaging with groups and rights holders in Israel, Palestine, and globally, to inform its report. Today, we’re publishing these findings and our response.

Due Diligence Insights

As BSR recognized in their report, the events of May 2021 surfaced industry-wide, long-standing challenges around content moderation in conflict-affected regions, and the need to protect freedom of expression while reducing the risk of online services being used to spread hate or incite violence. The report also highlighted how managing these issues was made more difficult by the complex conditions that surround the conflict, including its social and historical dynamics, various fast-moving violent events, and the actions and activities of terrorist organizations.

Despite these complications, BSR identified a number of areas of “good practice” in our response. These included our efforts to prioritize measures to reduce the risk of the platform being used to encourage violence or harm, including quickly establishing a dedicated Special Operations Center to respond to activity across our apps in real time. This center was staffed with expert teams, including regional experts and native speakers of Arabic and Hebrew, who worked to remove content that violated our policies, while also making sure we addressed errors in our enforcement as soon as we became aware of them. It also included our efforts to remove content that was proportionate and in line with global human rights standards.

As well as these areas of good practice, BSR concluded that different viewpoints, nationalities, ethnicities and religions were well represented in the teams working on this at Meta. They found no evidence of intentional bias on any of these grounds among any of these employees. They also found no evidence that in developing or implementing any of our policies we sought to benefit or harm any particular community.

That said, BSR did raise important concerns around under-enforcement of content, including inciting violence against Israelis and Jews on our platforms, and specific instances where they considered our policies and processes had an unintentional impact on Palestinian and Arab communities — primarily on their freedom of expression. BSR made 21 specific recommendations as a result of its due diligence, covering areas related to our policies, how those policies are enforced, and our efforts to provide transparency to our users.

Our Actions in Response to the Recommendations

Since we received the final report, we’ve carefully reviewed these recommendations to help us learn where and how we can improve. Our response details our commitment to implementing 10 of the recommendations, partly implementing four, and we’re assessing the feasibility of another six. We will take no further action on one recommendation.

There are no quick, overnight fixes to many of these recommendations, as BSR makes clear. While we have made significant changes as a result of this exercise already, this process will take time — including time to understand how some of these recommendations can best be addressed, and whether they are technically feasible.

Here’s an update on our work to address some of the key areas identified in the report:

Our Policies

BSR recommended that we review our policies on incitement to violence and Dangerous Individuals and Organisations (DOI) — rules we have in place that prohibit groups like terrorists, hate and criminal organizations, as defined by our policies, that proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence from having a presence on Facebook or Instagram. We assess these entities based on their behavior both online and offline – most significantly, their ties to violence. We have committed to implementing these recommendations, including launching a review of both these policy areas to examine how we approach political discussion of banned groups, and how we can do more to tackle content glorifying violence. As part of this comprehensive review, we will consult extensively with a broad spectrum of experts, academics, and stakeholders — not just in the region, but across the globe.

BSR also recommended that we tier the system of strikes and penalties we apply when people violate our DOI policy. We have committed to assessing the feasibility of this particular recommendation, but have already begun work to make this system simpler, more transparent, and more proportionate.

In addition, BSR encouraged us to conduct stakeholder engagement around and ensure transparency on our US legal obligations in this area. We have committed to partly implement this recommendation. While we regularly carry out broad stakeholder engagement on these policies and how they are enforced, we rely on legal counsel and relevant sanctions authorities to understand our specific compliance obligations in this area. We agree that transparency is critically important here and through our Community Standards, we provide details of how we define terrorist groups, how we tier them, and how these tierings impact the penalties we apply to people who break our rules.

Enforcement of Our Policies

BSR made a number of recommendations focused on our approach to reviewing content in Hebrew and Arabic.

BSR recommended that we continue work developing and deploying functioning machine learning classifiers in Hebrew. We’ve committed to implementing this recommendation, and since May 2021 have launched a Hebrew “hostile speech” classifier to help us proactively detect more violating Hebrew content. We believe this will significantly improve our capacity to handle situations like this, where we see major spikes in violating content.

BSR also recommended that we continue work to establish processes to better route potentially violating Arabic content by dialect for content review. We’re assessing the feasibility of this recommendation. We have large and diverse teams to review Arabic content, with native language skills and an understanding of the local cultural context across the region — including in Palestine. We also have systems in place which use technology to help determine what language content is in, so we can ensure it is reviewed by relevant content reviewers. We’re exploring a range of options to see how we can improve this process. This includes reviewing hiring more content reviewers with diverse dialect and language capabilities, and work to understand whether we can train our systems to better distinguish between different Arabic dialects to help route and review Arabic content.

BSR’s analysis notes that Facebook and Instagram prohibit antisemitic content as part of its hate speech policy, which doesn’t allow attacks against anyone based on their religion, or any other protected characteristic. BSR also notes that, because we don’t currently track the targets of hate speech, we’re not able to measure the prevalence of antisemitic content, and they’ve recommended that we develop a mechanism to allow us to do this. We agree it would be worthwhile to better understand the prevalence of specific types of hate speech, and we’ve committed to assessing the feasibility of this.

In addition, BSR recommended that we adjust the processes we have in place for updating and maintaining keywords associated with designated dangerous organizations, to help prevent hashtags being blocked in error — such as the error in May 2021 that temporarily restricted people’s ability to see content on the al-Aqsa hashtag page. While we quickly fixed this issue, it never should have happened in the first place. We have already implemented this recommendation, and have established a process to ensure expert teams at Meta are now responsible for vetting and approving these keywords.

Transparency

Underpinning all of this, BSR made a series of recommendations centered on helping people better understand our policies and processes.

BSR recommended that we provide specific and granular information to people when we remove violating content and apply “strikes.” We are implementing this recommendation in part, because some people violate multiple policies at the same time — creating challenges to how specific we can be at scale. We do already provide this specific and granular information in the majority of cases, and we have started to provide it in more cases, where it is possible to do so.

BSR also recommended that we disclose the number of formal reports received from government entities to remove content that doesn’t violate local law, but which potentially violates our Community Standards. We have committed to implementing this recommendation. We already publish a biannual report detailing how many pieces of content, by country, we restrict for violating local law as a result of a valid legal request. We are now working to expand the metrics we provide as part of this report to also include details on content removed for violating our policies following a government request.

BSR’s report is a critically important step forward for us and our work on human rights. Global events are dynamic, and so the ways in which we address safety, security and freedom of expression need to be dynamic too. Human rights assessments like these are an important way we can continue to improve our products, policies and processes.

For more information about additional steps we have taken, you can read our response to BSR’s assessment in full here. We will continue to keep people updated on our progress in our annual Human Rights report.",Met|##a|Human|Rights|Impact|Human|Rights|Human|Rights|Over|##sight|Board|Business|for|Social|Re|##sp|##ons|##ibility|BS|##R|BS|##R|BS|##R|BS|
45,"Donald Trump Sued For Fraud Because Keeping Two Sets Of Books Is Frowned Upon - Above the Law
New York Attorney General Tish James just filed a lawsuit against Donald Trump and basically every Trump except Tiffany and Barron. Specifically, the listed defendants are Donald J. Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, Allen Weisselberg, Jeffrey McConney, The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, The Trump Organization, Inc., and other businesses associated with Trump.

The complaint — available here — is over 200 pages and asks to prevent Trump and crew from serving as officers or directors of any NY company, replacing the trustees of Trump’s revocable trust, and barring them from applying for any loan from a NY registered financial organization for 5 years. [She’s also after $250 million in disgorgement… not to overlook that part]. The AG is also referring evidence it believes establishes multiple federal crimes to the proper authorities.

Sponsored How Today’s Challenges Are Forging Tomorrow’s Top GCs Join our expert panel on Oct. 20 for a deep dive into specific steps law departments can take to come out on top in the…

The suit stems from the AG’s investigation of widespread financial fraud on the part of the Trump family dating back years. Keeping two sets of books to overvalue properties when he sought loans and undervaluing them for tax purposes is… pretty much definitional fraud.

It’s the kind of curious announcement that is simultaneously the most and least shocking story imaginable.

Trump tried to collaterally attack the case… and failed. He tried to put off testimony… and failed. He tried to call the judge’s bluff on contempt… and failed. And he definitely must have held out hope that his longtime CFO wouldn’t really take a plea deal… that hope failed too. The case moved forward on rails, with Trump losing at every turn. His half-baked objections succeeded only in giving the AG’s office an opening to divulge relevant evidence in motion practice, providing the public a window into just how bad this would be for Trump if it ever reached this stage.

And yet! You always kind of suspected that he’d find a way to get out of it, right? Everyone with hands on the levers of power could see something like this going on for years and still did nothing. Like when Manhattan DA Cy Vance seemingly had the Trump kids dead to rights and let them go. Trump’s effort to delay this investigation by claiming that the fact his family had to take the Fifth repeatedly unfairly prejudiced them in the civil case, which has a ring of logic to it until you remember that committing a crime isn’t really an affirmative defense to a civil case.

Alas, the evidence couldn’t be brushed aside. The Trump Organization’s CFO testified that they overstated the size of Trump’s penthouse to the tune of roughly $200 million! And that’s just the testimony that’s already out there!

Leicester, England has descended into complete chaos as ongoing ethnoreligious clashes between Hindus and Muslims continue to flare, coming as the direct result of England’s open border policies and far-left policing practices that have allowed the situation to completely spiral out of control. Ethnoreligious clashes have been playing out in England now for weeks, spawning in the City of Leicester, where, thanks to open-borders policies, Brits make up just 45% of the population. In Leicester, mobs of fighting-age Muslim migrants, largely of Pakistani origin, have carried out organized assaults on the city’s Hindu faith Indian community, the men of which have risen up to respond to Islamic threats.

Judge rules Charter must pay $1.1 billion after murder of cable customer

Judge lowers $7B award but agrees Charter is liable.

Charter Communications must pay over $1.1 billion to the estate and family of an 83-year-old woman murdered in her home by a Spectrum cable technician, a Dallas County Court judge ruled yesterday. A jury in the same court previously ordered Charter to pay $7 billion in punitive damages and $337.5 million in compensatory damages. Judge Juan Renteria lowered the award in a ruling issued yesterday. The damages are split among the estate and four adult children of murder victim Betty Thomas. Renteria did not change the compensatory damages but lowered the punitive damages awarded to the family to $750 million. Pre-judgment interest on the damages pushes Charter's total liability to over $1.1 billion. It isn't surprising that the judge lowered the payout, in which the jury decided punitive damages should be over 20 times higher than what Charter is liable for in compensatory damages. A nine-to-one ratio is often used as a maximum because of a 2003 US Supreme Court ruling that said: ""In practice, few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process.""

How much Charter actually will pay and what it's insurance carrier pays are two different things.

Stop Cooking Chicken in Nyquil, FDA Begs in Response to Social Media Trend

Hard to believe this has to be said out loud, but... The US Food and Drug Administration is taking a bizarre trend seriously. It may seem like cooking up raw chicken in cough syrup is the stuff of nightmares, but videos purporting to do just that have appeared on platforms including TikTok and Instagram. Last week, the FDA issued a warning over the misuse of medicines as inspired by social media videos. TikTok condemned the Nyquil videos.

The older I get, the more frustrated I am by my own ignorance. When I was younger, my ignorance wasn’t much of a problem, because I was ignorant of how ignorant I was. Now I’m smart enough to realize how stupid I am, and I am constantly trying to fill the very serious gaps in my understanding of the world. I don’t, for instance, know what any of the different trees are called. I don’t know how the city sewer system works. I don’t know how to build a birdhouse, or knit a cardigan, or take apart a clock and put it back together. Don’t ask me to diagnose car trouble, bake a croissant, or draw a realistic sketch of an architectural landmark. I wish I could do all of these things, and someday I’ll learn. But for now, while I can read and write pretty well, and I remember some algebra and history, I am useless across a staggering number of domains. I only partly blame myself for this. I also blame the school system, which devalues practical knowledge. From first through 12th grade, I do not remember being offered a single class that would teach me to cook things, grow things, design things, or even how to learn how to do these things. There were no lessons in crucial subjects from how to open a drawer that is stuck to how to keep your life from becoming a wreck. School equipped me with a great deal of knowledge that I never needed and almost immediately forgot (e.g., trigonometry), and left me totally unprepared to deal with many of the most basic challenges of adulthood. I am grateful that I was taught how to read and introduced to certain great works of literature (although English class managed to make reading Shakespeare miserable, and the stuff I really enjoyed back then—like Kurt Vonnegut—I had to find on my own).

I'll be honest. Growing up I attended schools that concentrated on reading, writing and arithmetic. Throw in some civics, western civilization, religion and foreign languages. Interesting piece: 'Six Subjects That Should Be Required In School But Aren’t - Basic education should be both more practical and more intellectual.'

When it comes to skills around the house or garage, fathers and mothers play a large roll or no roll whatsoever. It isn't up to the school system to be educators and parents. Although they are sadly becoming the ""parents"" to many children.

REVERSING THE FLOW —

How electric cars could rescue the US power grid

By 2035, batteries in California BEVs could power every home in the state for 3 days. Last month, California finalized a rule that will ban the sale of new gas-powered cars, starting in 2035. Obviously, that’ll accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles and encourage other states to do the same. (Oregon has already followed California’s lead.) But less obviously, spurning carbon-spewing vehicles could help buttress the United States’ ancient, creaky electrical grids. Cars are no longer just modes of transportation; they are increasingly integrated into the larger energy infrastructure. If your EV is sitting in your garage fully charged (cars are typically parked 95 percent of the time) and you lose power, that big battery offers an opportunity to keep the lights on. And when there’s a sudden spike in demand for the grid—because everyone wants to turn on their AC during a heat wave or their heat during a deep freeze—utilities could pay homeowners for their excess battery power.

Ah unicorns and rainbows for everyone. Peace, love and understanding throughout the land.

48,"What the EU Green Deal means for potato production in SA
Estimated reading time: 7 minutes

The European Commission stipulates that the European Union’s (EU) production activities become climate-neutral by 2050.

The EU Farm to Fork Strategy was also launched in 2020 as part of the EU Green Deal to focus on guidelines for food production.

All countries exporting to the EU will need to comply with these regulations.

A core focus area of EU potato production is reducing dependency on crop protection products and fertilisation, as well as increasing organic farming and reversing biodiversity loss.

Producers will need to farm alongside nature.

Collaboration with innovation suppliers and regulators is critical, and utilising and understanding data will enable Potatoes SA to mitigate risks.

The European Commission has initiated a bold strategy, stipulating that the European Union’s (EU) production activities become climate-neutral by 2050. This forms part of the EU Green Deal which aims to enable sustainable and inclusive economic growth in all economic sectors without impacting natural resources.

The EU has committed a significant investment towards the restoration of ecosystems. This has triggered many debates on the viability of this strategy, as seen in recent farmer protests in the Netherlands against the EU’s demands to reduce nitrogen oxide and ammonia produced by farm animals.

The EU Farm to Fork Strategy was also launched in 2020 as part of the EU Green Deal to focus specifically on guidelines for food production. This is aimed at making Europe climate-neutral and protecting nature through the efficient use of its resources to create a clean agricultural economy, reduce pollution and ensure decent water quality.

It is important to mention that all countries exporting to the EU will need to comply with these regulations. The main focus areas of the EU Farm to Fork Strategy are illustrated in Figure 1.

Cutting pesticide use by half

A core focus area of EU potato production is reducing dependency on crop protection products and fertilisation, as well as increasing organic farming and reversing biodiversity loss. During the last five years, the EU has already managed a 20% decrease in the use of pesticides and plans to achieve the following goals by 2030 (Figure 2):

Reduce the overall use and risk of chemical pesticides by 50%, specifically focussing on reducing What the EU Green Deal means for potato production in South Africa This will be achieved by promoting integrated pest management (IPM) and greater use of alternative methods of protecting harvests from pests and diseases.

A 50% reduction in nutrient losses (especially nitrogen and phosphorus), bearing in mind that not all nutrients are absorbed by plants.

Limiting the deterioration in soil fertility and reducing fertiliser use by at least 20% by 2030.

The benefits in terms of potato production will include:

Crop protection offers that contain biologically active substances will be supported by reducing the length of the pesticide authorisation process in EU member states.

Food systems that rely on seed security, diversity, and access to a range of quality seeds for plant varieties that are adapted to the environmental pressures will be encouraged by the European Commission as a positive spin-off.

Given the increase in fertiliser costs, more efficient fertiliser utilisation is now an important research focus.

It is also expected that 25% of the EU’s agricultural land will shift to organic farming by 2030. This could benefit exports to the EU.

With this in mind, the Sustainable Development Goals intend to also reduce food loss and waste. One aspect that is highlighted is the misunderstanding and misuse of date marking (‘use by’ and ‘best before’ dates), which contribute to food waste.

Impact on local potato growers

Although South Africa does not export potatoes to the EU, we are reliant on innovation that is developed in the EU by multinational research-based crop protection companies. CropLife estimates that it costs around $250 million to develop a new crop protection solution.

Legislation in the EU requires that products complete a rigorous renewal process, which includes a detailed data revision. This increases the cost of registration, while the length of the process shortens the commercial lifespan of many valuable crop protection solutions. This means the frequency of new product introductions will decline. Furthermore, trusted crop protection solutions will disappear from the market.

We can expect newer and gentler products to be developed. These will be targeted products and will require a better understanding of positioning in the potato growth cycle. The greatest crop protection input from a potato producer’s side is nematicides. Specific pressure is being put on the use of toxicity class 1 nematicides, which will be phased out and therefore limit viable control options. Growers will

need to rely on alternative cropping methods to reduce the nematode risk. This is also a research focus area of Potatoes SA (PSA).

Another example is seen in the non-renewal of imidacloprid and chlorpyriphos, as well as the debate around mancozeb in the EU. This has already had a significant impact on the fruit export industry. Fortunately, these options are still available for use on potatoes. In South Africa,

however, we can expect pressure on these products in respect of future availability and regulatory requirements.

Alternative methods of control

During a recent meeting of the European Association for Potato Research in Kraków, Poland, the challenge of aphid control in Europe was highlighted by the non-renewal of traditional aphicides such as thiacloprid, imidacloprid and chlorpyriphos. European growers are now dependent on mineral oils which provide a much-reduced efficacy.

Fortunately, the EU has launched an initiative to stimulate the development of biological alternatives. This means the tools available to control pests and diseases will decrease. This will result in advisers and research-based companies understanding the positioning of new crop protection

options and keeping crop growth and pest development stages, as well as environmental conditions in mind.

The days of 100% control are over. Producers will need to farm alongside nature using the following techniques:

• Mating disruption for insect control.

• Release of beneficial predators.

• Attract-and-kill alternatives.

• Use of green manure and crop rotation strategies.

One concern remains, namely that limited choices will trigger a shift in sensitivity toward existing crop protection offers. This has already been reported globally in the case of challenges such as early blight, late blight and Lepidoptera control.

To prevent a shift in sensitivity, the following mitigating factors can be implemented:

Integrate biological alternatives: The efficacy may initially be lower than traditional pesticides. Populations that show a shift in sensitivity are, however, often weaker and more easily controlled by these compounds. It is also important to understand pest biology to apply these products at the correct time.

Introduce agronomic measures to reduce populations. Many diseases are triggered by stress or high fertiliser levels.

CropLife International has developed clear guidelines on managing risks:

How will PSA address challenges?

The EU Farm to Fork Strategy is here to stay and will impact how potatoes are produced. Research projects have been initiated with a view to investigating the following topics:

Impact of green manure and crop rotation in managing nematodes and soil-borne diseases.

Evaluation of the status of sensitivity shifts against registered products for the control of early blight, late blight and potato tuber moth.

Evaluating nutrient- and water-use efficiencies to promote plant health.

Understanding the response of potatoes to elevated temperature and CO2 combinations.

Collaboration with innovation suppliers and regulators is critical, and utilising and understanding data will enable us to mitigate risks and make better decisions to produce potatoes more efficiently. – By Dirk Uys, Potatoes SA

DALLAS – Today in Aviation, CR Airways (N8) was rebranded as Hong Kong Airlines (HX) in 2006. A new livery and logo were unveiled, based around the city’s symbol, the Bauhinia flower.

CR Airways began life in March 2001 as a helicopter operator using a single Sikorsky S-76C+. In June 2003, it received its first Canadair Regional Jet CRJ-200 from Shandong Airlines (SC). It launched passenger flights in July 2003 with a thrice-weekly charter link to Laoag, Philippines.

In 2005, N8 signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Boeing for ten 787 Dreamliners and 30 Boeing 737-800s. These aircraft were part of an order originally placed by Hainan Airlines (HU), which had begun the process of taking over the airline.

HNA Group Takeover

The takeover was confirmed on June 27, 2006, with HU owner the HNA Group purchasing around a 60% shareholding. The purchase was to expand HU’s presence in the Hong Kong market to connect the city with China and beyond.

Plans initially were to rebrand both airlines as Grand China Air. However, this idea was shelved with Hainan keeping its branding and CR Airways becoming Hong Kong Airlines.

In recent years, the carrier has struggled financially due to the ongoing political and social unrest in Hong Kong. It has also come under intense scrutiny over its financial health by the city’s civil aviation authorities, as rumors circulated over a possible liquidation.

The COVID-19 pandemic also led to the carrier to cut 700 jobs and ground its entire Airbus A320 fleet.",CR|Airways|Hong|Kong|Airlines|D|##AL|##LA|Aviation|CR|Airways|Hong|Kong|Airlines|H|##X|CR|Airways|Si|Canada|##ir|Shan|##dong|Airlines|SC|N|Boeing|Hai|##nan|Airlines|H|##U|CR|Airways|M|Ra|##zi|Des|##a|W|##media|Commons|H|##NA|Group|H|H|##NA|Group|H|Grand|China|Air|Hai|##nan|CR|Airways|Hong|Kong|Airlines|

53,"Albanian Daily News
One of the main topics of the interview that Albanian Daily News had with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for European Affairs of Montenegro, Jovana Marovic was the cyber-attacks against the state and government institutions of this Balkan country and their impact on the normal functioning of the government system. Dr. Marovic, a former Executive Director of the Politikon Network, a think tank based in Podgorica, who worked as a Counselor for the European Union in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ multilateral department division between 2004 and 2016, is concerned as the wave of attacks was symptomatic during August and the first half of September because cyber-attacks on state authorities and companies were registered in Montenegro, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, while in Serbia they occurred in July.

“This is a great threat and warning for the countries of the Western Balkans, and I think that we must take it very seriously and extremely responsibly, and treat it professionally,” said Dr. Marovic, who believed that solutions should be sought in cooperation with the member states of the EU and NATO, which are our strategic partners.

Asked about the current situation in Montenegro, the deputy PM said the political situation in the country is complex and intensive consultations were held over the last week or so, trying to reach an agreement on establishment of a new government. “In the meantime, the Government is in a technical mandate and has a lot of work to do, both in terms of fulfilling obligations from the EU agenda facing the economic situation, primarily the global energy crisis. In that regard, the Government came up with solutions and measures, so that citizens would be affected as little as possible,” said Dr. Marovic.

With regard to the Open Balkans initiative, the number two of Podgorica’s government revealed that based on a detailed analysis and assessment of the impact of membership on the citizens’ quality of life, the economy and the entire society, the Government will decide on potential participation.

The energy crisis was, certainly, a major topic of the discussion and Dr. Marovic announced that taking into account the measures that the countries of the European Union and the region have introduced so far with regard to energy savings Montenegro has considered all applicable solutions, paying special attention to the citizens’ standard, the economy and the energy sector companies.

Touching upon the bilateral cooperation between Montenegro and Albania she assessed it as very good being characterized by good neighbourly relations, as it should be when it comes to neighbouring countries. “Certainly, there is always room for improvement, in various fields, and this should be the subject of further discussions.”

Albanian Daily News: Madame Deputy Prime Minister, there are some weeks that Montenegro is under coordinated cyber-attack. First of all, which is its impact on the normal functioning of the state and which are the main targets of the attack?

Montenegrin Deputy PM Jovana Marovic: Cyber-attacks on the Montenegrin Government’s information network started on August 22, when access to websites and emails was disabled. The repair of the network and certain services is still ongoing.

The Ministry of the Interior and the State Prosecutor's Office are involved in the investigation of attacks, while the National Security Council of Montenegro has formed an Operational Team that deals with it. In addition, we have sent a request to European partners for expert assistance, to restore the data taken during the attack.

Also, at the beginning of September, experts from the American FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) arrived in Montenegro to assist in overcoming the consequences of cyber-attacks on state institutions. Apart from them, we have received expert assistance from Great Britain and France.

These attacks have disrupted the work of state authorities, slowed down and made communication difficult, but on the other hand, they ""forced"" us to analyse the weaknesses of our information system and do everything necessary to improve it and make it more ready to respond to situations like this one.

-There is common talk that Russia is behind this attack against Montenegro like against some other countries in the region. Similar cyber-attacks have also hit Albania, but its authorities and strategic allies and NATO have said Iran is behind them. Do you think that there is a common front between Russia and Iran in such a massive cyber war, and how can the countries which are hit cooperate to bring things to normality and build a joint shield of protection?

- After the conducted investigations, the Ministry of Public Administration informed the public that the criminal group ""Cuba Ransomware"", known since 2018, was behind the cyber-attack. According to the Ministry’s information, the creation of the virus has cost around $ 10 million and it had never been used anywhere before.

At the moment, it is difficult to say with certainty who is behind the mentioned criminal group because there are many different types of influence – political, economic and security in nature.

It is symptomatic that during August and the first half of September, cyber-attacks on state authorities and companies were registered in Montenegro, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, while in Serbia they occurred in July.

This is a great threat and warning for the countries of the Western Balkans, and I think that we must take it very seriously and extremely responsibly, and treat it professionally. In this sense, I believe that solutions should be sought in cooperation with the member states of the EU and NATO, which are our strategic partners, and in this way prepare a system for reacting in any future similar situations.

- In the meantime, please, which is your assessment of the political situation in Montenegro and do incidents like the latest cyber-attacks aggravate the situation?

- The political situation in the country is complex and we had intensive consultations over the last week or so, trying to reach an agreement on the establishment of a new government. In the meantime, the Government is in a technical mandate and has a lot of work to do, both in terms of fulfilling obligations from the EU agenda facing the economic situation, primarily the global energy crisis. In that regard, the Government came up with solutions and measures, so that citizens would be affected as little as possible.

- Open Balkans held its annual forum and Montenegro attended all its deliberations in Belgrade. Ms. Deputy PM, does this mean a gradual membership of your country to the project, and on what basis the previous ‘No!’ might turn into a fully positive approach? Which are initiatives’ deliveries, making government supporters of the project join it and does the lack of consensus add to the current difference within the ruling coalition and with the opposition?

- Prime Minister Abazovic attended the opening of the ""Wine Vision of the Open Balkans"" fair, which was organized as a part of the aforementioned regional initiative.

On that occasion, the Prime Minister stated that the countries of the region must cooperate, especially in terms of preventing the global crisis, and seek for the best joint solutions for the citizens in the region.

When it comes to the initiative itself, the Ministry of European Affairs has been preparing an analysis on the Open Balkans, with the plan to have it ready by the end of the month. The Ministry expects contributions from all government departments, and once we have the draft analysis completed, we will form a working group where representatives of the civil society will be included as well, to contribute to the final document.

Therefore, the Ministry and the Government approached this issue seriously and responsibly. Based on a detailed analysis and assessment of the impact of membership on the citizens’ quality of life, the economy and the entire society, the Government will decide on potential participation.

- Ms. Marovic the energy crisis is increasingly crippling the economies of Europe and particularly of Western Balkan countries. Which are the steps taken by your government to cope with the situation and according to you, how would an eventual long – term crisis affect people’s life and upset social order?

- The energy crisis, which has affected a large part of Europe, has already affected the countries of the region, and it is certain that it will affect the energy situation in Montenegro to a certain extent.

Taking into account the measures that the countries of the European Union and the region have introduced so far with regard to energy savings, Montenegro has considered all applicable solutions, paying special attention to the citizens’ standard, the economy and the energy sector companies.

In this regard, at the last session, the Government adopted the Report on the work of the National Council for the Analysis and Monitoring of the Security of Energy and Energy Supply, along with the Proposal of Recommendations for Reducing Electricity Consumption. Those recommendations were sent to state administration bodies, local governments, state enterprises, and public institutions.

Apart from them, an important thing we are working on is educating the population on how to use electricity wisely.

-As a follow up, Madame Deputy PM, are there possibilities for a more efficient cooperation between Albania and Montenegro, and why not with other regional countries to mitigate the severe impact of the energy crisis?

- I think that the bilateral cooperation between Montenegro and Albania is very good and that it is characterized by good neighbourly relations, as it should be when it comes to neighbouring countries. Certainly, there is always room for improvement, in various fields, and this should be the subject of further discussions. When it comes to regional cooperation in the context of the energy crisis consequences, I think that all existing regional and international initiatives, as well as bilateral cooperation, should be used in order to reduce the consequences of the crisis. We are obliged to provide our citizens with the conditions for quality life and work and, in this sense we should all find the best solutions together, both for overcoming the consequences of the crisis and for accelerated economic development and stepping up of the EU accession process.

- To conclude, Ms. Marovic, do you think that the EU is still ‘getting lost’ in its troubles forgetting the Western Balkans and promises for energetic actions to expedite the integration process? Does such an approach encourage the so- called ‘bad guys’ to step up their interference drive in the region against the background of the Ukraine war and a new escalation of the armed conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia?

- The region of the Western Balkans has always been suitable for external influences. The EU’s approach, the growing energy crisis, with the accompanying economic crisis, can lead to destabilization in the region and disillusionment with European integration.

For this reason, it is very important, more than ever before, for the EU to strengthen its presence in the Western Balkans and help the countries to speed up the reforms. This is of fundamental importance for the democratization of the region and for the EU itself, as the Western Balkans is a strategically important part of Europe, which has been proven by recent global events. In this sense, I expect stronger support from the EU to the region in dealing with the consequences of the growing global crisis.",Albanian|News|Albanian|Daily|News|European|Affairs|Pol|##iti|##kon|Network|European|Union|Ministry|of|Foreign|Affairs|EU|NATO|EU|Open|Balkans|European|Union|

General director of the European Committee of Trade Unions for Education, Susan Flocken, has not managed to find a solution to end the strike in the education sector in Kosovo.

Flocken, together with representatives of the United Union for Science and Culture (SBASHK), met on July 21 with the Prime Minister of Kosovo, Albin Kurti, but the parties did not reach an agreement.



""I came here from Brussels to find a solution to this issue, as the teachers are on strike, very clearly asking for a pay rise. However, they are demanding the implementation of the Law on health insurance, and they also have a request for the reform of the pension scheme. We had a long meeting [with the Prime Minister of Kosovo, Albin Kurti], but we were not able to find a solution"", said Flocken during a press conference in Pristina.



She said she will inform the European Commission about the meeting with Kurti, as she has done all this time, since the education sector in Kosovo went on strike on August 25.



""We support the SBASHK in its demands and the members of the SBASHK, the teachers of Kosovo"", said Flocken.



The chairman of SBASHK, Rrahman Jasharaj, said he was at the meeting, but the meeting focused on the conversation between Kurti and Flocke. He accused the Government of not giving ""any sign"" that it is ready to dialogue with the trade unionists.



Since August 25, education workers in the private sector have gone on strike, along with administration workers at the central and local levels. The trade unionists are asking to benefit from 100 euros per month until the entry into force of the Law on wages.



The Government of Kosovo said that the meeting emphasized the need for trade unions to participate in public discussions about the Salary Law, which according to the executive ""is intended to ensure equality and dignified treatment of the public sector in the country"".



""In the new Salary Bill, all categories of education workers have been treated with special care, while teachers will have the highest coefficient ever, it was said at the meeting,"" said the Kurti Office announcement.



The government of Kosovo, through a recently approved package to help citizens overcome the inflation crisis, has allocated 50 euros per month for private sector employees.



Trade unionists have said that this amount is insufficient. The strike was broken only in some schools by teachers who individually started to keep the lessons. As the strike in education continues, more than 300,000 students remain outside the school banks.",News|European|Committee|of|Trade|Union|##s|for|Education|United|Union|for|Science|and|Culture|S|##BA|##S|##H|##K|European|Commission|S|##BA|##S|##H|##K|S|##BA|##S|##H|##K|S|##BA|##S|##H|##K|Government|Government|of|Sal|

Mission Every One, the social purpose platform of the department store chain, recently reiterated its commitment to work for a more equitable and sustainable future for all.

Highlighting its plan for environmental sustainability goals, Macy's Inc. presented this new initiative that promotes circularity throughout its value chain, thus seeking to extend the useful life of a product.

Keelin Evans, vice president of sustainability at Macy’s, Inc, stated:

As a leading, omnichannel retailer, we understand the role we play in creating a more equitable and sustainable future for all. We are committed to promoting a more circular economy across our value chain.

Circular Economy

As part of this project, in early 2021 Macy's joined forces with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, focused on accelerating and enabling the transition to a global circular economy, and with FABSCRAP, a New York-based nonprofit that helps ensure that Fabric waste, an inevitable part of the design and development process, is reused and recycled responsibly.

“Our efforts are focused on providing sustainable and ethically produced brands, products, and services to our customers, while reducing our impact on the environment through operations. We’re going to achieve this through our guiding social purpose platform, Mission Every One, and an enterprise-wide collaboration with partners, designers, suppliers, logistics partners, entrepreneurs, colleagues and customers,” added Evans.

To reuse and extend the life of all products, Macy's reverse logistics team is dedicated to moving products from customers to vendors or manufacturers, or selling them to resellers to continue the product life cycle.

Also, so that customers can be part of this responsible life cycle of their clothing, toys and other used items, they will be able to download a prepaid shipping label from the Macy's website and send it for resale and recycling thanks to the alliance with Give Back Box.

Almost everything can be recycled. Photo: Pixabay.

Reduce, Reuse and Recycle

Seeking to apply these three concepts in its operations cycle, Macy's has implemented a technology that allows reducing the number of physical samples required from suppliers without affecting design considerations such as fit and color.

Over the past year and a half, the company has also introduced several initiatives to reduce, reuse and recycle across its market and private-label product offerings and operations.

“In 2019, 5% of samples were digital and by the end of the 2022 development season, 61% of all samples were made virtually. This shift actively keeps product that would otherwise not have use, out of landfills,” noted Macy’s highlighting that thanks to these new industrial processes, textile waste has been significantly reduced.

In addition, both Macy's and Bloomingdale's offer care instructions and programs to help customers extend product life and reduce water and electricity use.

Special Packaging

Macy's has also adopted best practices to reduce packaging, including standardizing the size of packaging boxes and minimizing packaging materials:

Auto-boxer and auto-bagger technology enables Macy's to create unique packaging that accommodates odd or oversized items and reduces box volume and waste by up to 50%.

In 2022, virgin plastic postal bags were edited to include 35% recycled content, reducing bag thickness by 20%. As a result, the input of virgin plastic was reduced by more than 50%.

All paperboard used by Macy's fulfillment centers is FSC certified and is made up of 35% recycled content.

As of spring 2022, most digital order packages handled by its fulfillment centers did not include paper invoices to reduce unnecessary waste as customers can reference order information in their online accounts and mail-in receipts electronic.

Pilot Program

As part of its 2025 goals to recycle as much material as possible, Macy's Beauty Products team launched a pilot program to minimize environmental impact by sending outdated warranties to a third party for recycling instead of disposal in the shop.

Macy's also launched a program to use RFID technology to track store cardboard recycling shares and weights as part of its goal to increase store recycling rates to 80% by 2025.

57,"Ethiopia: News Update - Amhara State Police Detain Zemene Kassie, a Well-Known Fano Militia Leader
Addis Abeba — The Amhara Regional Police Commission announced that Zemen Kassie, a well-known Fano militia leader, otherwise known as ""patriot Zemene"" has been taken into police custody in Bahir Dar, the capital of the regional state.

According to the AMC, the regional state media, in the statement issued by Commander Kindu Wonde, Deputy Head of Tactical Investigation Department of the Amhara Region Police Commission, Zemene is currently being investigated by the law enforcement agencies. He was detained at a private house in Kebele 03 in Bahir Dar after tips from community members, the police said.

Zemene is known to have been in hiding over the past several months following a major crackdown by regional and federal security forces against members of the Fano, an informal armed group operating in Amhara region.

In July this year, the Ethiopian joint security and intelligence task force, which is comprised of the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS), Ethiopian National Defense Forces (ENDF), the Federal Police Commission, and Information Network Security Administration (INSA) said that some 5, 804 ""extremist Fano"" members were detained and were being investigated accused of attempts ""to spread violence."" These include those who ""were convicted by a court, who were at large, and who were wanted for murder,"" the task force said at the time.

The joint task force praised those ""Fano members"" that it said have ""fought against"" Tigrayan forces ""during the law enforcement campaign in the northern part of our country"" and said they were ""helping the security forces"" including ""the national defense and other security forces, [and] have contributed to the peace and security in the region today and continued this good work."" But it accused those it said were operating ""under the guise"" of the real Fano, but spreading violence throughout the Amhara regional state using illegal weapons; it also accused them of recruiting ""youths without the recognition of the national defense forces and police institutions, trained them secretly and armed them with illegal weapons.""

The crackdown has already started in mid-May this year, when the region's Peace and Security Bureau chief, Desalegn Tassew, said that 4,552 suspects have been arrested in connection with the ongoing ""rule of law operation"" in the region since a week ago.

Of these, more than 1,780 were suspects who failed to discharge their public duties, including members of the regional security forces. The Bureau Chief also said ""the suspects arrested also include those suspected of using social media, both inside and outside the region, ""to further destabilize the region,"" Desalegn said.

In the statement today, Commander Kindu was quoted as saying Zemene was detained along with 541, 000 birr in his possession, and other exhibits seized from the scene of the arrest. ""He confirmed that the investigation will be conducted by the regional police commission.

The Commander said that Zemene is ""a suspect who has been wanted by law"" and his ""arrest shows that no one can escape from the law.""

58,"Nigeria: Reps Panel Probes NNPCL JV Contracts With IOCs, Summons Malami, Kyari
The panel said it discovered some accounts operated by NNPCL without the knowledge of the office of the Accountant General of the Federation.

The ad hoc committee of the House of Representatives investigating the joint venture business and production sharing contracts between NNPC Limited and international oil companies, has summoned the Attorney General, Abubakar Malami, and the CEO of NNPC Limited, Mele Kyari.

They are to appear before the committee on Tuesday alongside other relevant heads of agencies connected to the petroleum upstream sector.

The Chairman of the Committee, Abubakar Fulata, (APC, Jigawa) issued the summon on Tuesday after the committee discovered some accounts operated by NNPCL without the knowledge of the office of the Accountant General of the Federation.

The representative of OAGF, Onochie Peter, was unable to present documents to back remittances from the JV contracts.

Mr Peter, who is the director of audit monitoring in the OAGF, said, ""these accounts are operated by NNPCL. Yes, it's not run by Accountant General Office. The accounts are domiciled in the Central Bank of Nigeria, we are not the owners. The proceeds of agreements comes to the federation accounts. But we will endeavor to get the necessary documents.""

Responding to the submission of the OAGF, Mr Fulata expressed dissatisfaction with the claim by Mr Peters.

He insisted that records of all revenue should be in the system of the OAGF.

You should have these kind of records in your system,"" he said.

A member of the Committee, Mark Gbillah (PDP, Benue), accused the NNPCL of operating secret accounts. He noted the company operates like a quasi government.

""So you're saying that there is a separate cash call account that even the accountant general has no access (to). This is a serious issue, this committee needs to look into it. NNPCL seems to be operating as a quasi government on its own,"" Mr Gbillah said.

Ruling on the matter, Mr Fulata said all invited heads of agencies must appear, as he frowned against agencies and IOCs that sent representatives.

59,"Nigeria: NANS Rejects Ruling Against ASUU, Says Lecturers Can't Be Forced Back to Work
The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has rejected an Industrial Court judgement which ordered Academic Staff Union of University (ASUU) to suspend its ongoing strike immediately.

The National Industrial Court of Nigeria (NICN) in Abuja had ordered ASUU to immediately suspend the ongoing industrial action.

Justice Polycarp Hamman on Wednesday held that the strike was a breach of the Section 18(1)(2) of the Trade Disputes Act, which prohibits their action.

Reacting, the National Public Relations Officer of NANS, Giwa Yisa Temitope, described the ruling as a ""black market judgment.""

Temitope said the ruling betrayed equity because the Federal Government ought not to drag the academic union before the court an initio.

According to him, the only remedy to this strike action is for the Federal Government to accede to the demands of ASUU which the government willingly entered into with them and properly fund education.

The statement reads ""Our attention has been drawn to a news of a court judgment mandating the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) to call of its 7 month strike. As an association, we feel disturbed to read the news of the judgment because we believe that it betrays equity.

""Ordinarily, the Federal Government is not meant to have dragged ASUU to court. But, the fact that they had to drag ASUU to court is a signal that this government cannot handle crisis. And, we want to state categorically that the court cannot force members of ASUU back to lecture theatres.

""And, as it stands today, with that court judgment, we maintain that the court has not resolved the problem and we reject the judgment in strong terms. The court could have said that the Federal Government should go and pay rather than say that lecturers who are on strike should go back to classrooms. We were expecting the court to have understood that lecturers are on contract of personal service hence, they cannot be compelled to render a service they don't want to render.

61,"Nigeria: Swiss-Based AOG Funded Joint Accounts With Nigerian Politicians, Others
In the 1990s, executives at an obscure energy company bribed Nigerian officials to obtain spectacularly profitable oil mining licenses. Now, the Suisse Secrets project reveals that the company's parent firm poured money into Swiss bank accounts held jointly by its employees and African elites, including a Nigerian spy chief.

KEY FINDINGS:

Four employees of AOG, an investment group linked to a bribery scandal in Nigeria, held joint Credit Suisse accounts with political figures from West and Central Africa.

The account holders included Umaru Ali Shinkafi, a former Nigerian spy chief and associate of military ruler Sani Abacha.

The opening dates and maximum balances on the accounts mirror the rise of AOG subsidiary Addax Petroleum, the firm at the heart of the bribery scandal.

Shinkafi at one point held a stake in AOG that was never made public.

In May of 1998, an obscure company called Addax Petroleum came from nowhere to take Nigeria's oil industry by storm, scoring one of the most lucrative deals the country had ever seen.

Despite having no record in oil extraction, Addax scooped up four valuable oil exploration and production licenses. The deal set off a spectacular rise for the Swiss-based firm, which was registered on the tiny Caribbean island of Curaçao. After going public in 2006, it was sold three years later to China's state oil giant for $7.2 billion.

Years later, a French court case uncovered some of the hidden reasons behind the company's sudden success: Addax executives testified that they had paid $5 million in bribes into the Swiss bank account of Nigeria's oil minister during the military dictatorship of General Sani Abacha, who ruled the West African nation for five years after seizing power in a 1993 coup.

The payments, testimony showed, were made to secure the oil licenses of Ashland Inc., an American energy firm that had fallen into dispute with Nigerian authorities. Addax had also set up Swiss accounts for Mr Abacha's two oldest sons, and used Swiss banks to funnel millions in illicit ""commissions"" to Nigerian officials, the case showed.

Now, OCCRP has uncovered new evidence that executives at the Addax and Oryx Group (AOG), the investment firm that owned Addax, maintained secret financial ties with politicians in West and Central Africa as Addax prospered. Like the bribes, this money was also routed through the Swiss banking system.

Among those to benefit were Umaru Ali Shinkafi, a former Nigerian spy chief whose ties to the company were not publicly reported. Mr Shinkafi also held a valuable stake in AOG by 2015, according to a share register obtained by OCCRP.

Olanrewaju Suraju, a Nigerian anti-corruption activist and chairman of Human and Environmental Development Agenda, said that given Addax's track record of bribery to people surrounding the Abacha government, it was possible the newly discovered accounts were also intended as payments for government officials.

In total, four employees of Addax and AOG held five joint accounts with these politicians at Credit Suisse, starting as early as the mid-1990s according to the leaked Suisse Secrets data. Some remained open well into the last decade. The account-holders included one of Mr Shinkafi's long-time associates, as well as multiple political figures in Senegal and the Republic of the Congo, countries where Addax and AOG also operated.

The first joint account, which had eleven signatories, was opened in 1994, the same year Addax Petroleum was founded. The account was worth 62 million Swiss francs ($53.32 million) in 2005, the year Addax incorporated in Canada and paid out tens of millions of dollars in its first publicly disclosed dividends.

The following year, shortly after Addax listed its shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the same eleven people opened four new Credit Suisse accounts together.

AOG acknowledged that the bank accounts existed, but said they were ""not secret accounts but rather bank accounts which were opened, held and operated by AOG group entities and which have been used for usual business purposes,"" including to pay out dividends or carry out share buybacks.

They said the individuals on the accounts had become AOG shareholders for ""modest amounts,"" either as part of an incentive programme for employees and directors or at their issued nominal value during the company's first fundraising round. At the time, ""none of them was holding a political mandate,"" the company said.

David Mühlemann, a financial and legal expert at Swiss NGO Public Eye told OCCRP that AOG's explanation about the joint accounts was not convincing, noting that there are other, more standard ways of paying dividends.

""It's easy to transfer money from one account to another. It's not magic to do that,"" Mr Mühlemann said.

""At first glance, I can hardly think of legitimate purposes why AOG should hold joint accounts with high-ranking political figures.""

The Suisse Secrets Investigation

Suisse Secrets is a collaborative journalism project based on leaked bank account data from Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse.

The data was provided by an anonymous source to the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, which shared it with OCCRP and 46 other media partners around the world. Reporters on five continents combed through thousands of bank records, interviewed insiders, regulators, and criminal prosecutors, and dug into court records and financial disclosures to corroborate their findings. The data covers over 18,000 accounts that were open from the 1940s until well into the last decade. Together, they held funds worth more than $100 billion.

""I believe that Swiss banking secrecy laws are immoral,"" the source of the data said in a statement. ""The pretext of protecting financial privacy is merely a fig leaf covering the shameful role of Swiss banks as collaborators of tax evaders. This situation enables corruption and starves developing countries of much-needed tax revenue.""

Because the Credit Suisse data obtained by journalists is incomplete, there are a number of important caveats to be kept in mind when interpreting it. .

Credit Suisse, in a statement, insisted that Swiss law does not authorize it to comment on client relationships.

""As publicly stated in our press release published on 20 February this year, we have taken a series of significant measures over the last decade, in line with financial market reforms, to combat financial crime. Our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business,"" the bank said.

Mr Shinkafi died in 2016. His daughter and son-in-law did not respond to requests for comment.

Addax's History of Bribery

AOG was founded in 1987 in Geneva by four Swiss businessmen and registered in the British Virgin Islands. The firm started out trading refined oil products and then moved into storing and distributing oil products in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1994, AOG founded Addax Petroleum as a subsidiary for oil exploration and production.

Though it was an oil firm on paper, Addax's first activities in Nigeria were dedicated to helping Mr Abacha and his associates set up financial infrastructure to receive millions of dollars' worth of bribes, according to later court findings.

Working on a tip from France's Finance Ministry, French investigators would later find that Richard Granier-Deferre, a French-born Addax Petroleum executive in Geneva, had opened accounts on behalf of Abacha's two oldest sons at Banque Edouard Constant in Geneva in 1995. He also set up an account for Bukazi Etete, the brother of Nigeria's oil minister Dan Etete.

In January 1997, Addax transferred $920,000, described as ""hidden commissions,"" into Mr Etete's brother's account to win a contract for delivery of refined Nigerian oil products from the state's oil company, according to court records.

Addax was not alone in making such payments: Nine companies, including Britain's Attock Oil International and the Swiss commodities trader Glencore, also paid money into Bukazi Etete's account. In total, some $19 million and roughly 5.5 million German marks passed through the account between 1995 and 1997, records show.

Mr Granier-Deferre maintained power of attorney over Mr Etete's Swiss accounts, which he used to move deposits into Addax's own Swiss accounts. In Nigeria, Addax would then pay out the same amounts in cash to officials, he said.

Banque Edouard Constant closed the accounts in 1997, after numerous suspicious deposits, including a $12 million transfer sent in a single day to Mr Abacha's sons' account. Undeterred, Granier-Deferre opened new accounts for the group at other Swiss banks. One such account was at Credit Suisse. Opened under the name ""Omoni Amalfegha,"" a known alias for Dan Etete, it was soon filled with $3 million in transfers. (This account did not appear in Suisse Secrets data.)

Messrs Granier-Deferre and Dan Etete were eventually both convicted of aggravated money laundering -- Etete in absentia -- and received prison terms which were converted to fines on appeal.

All in all, Mr Granier-Deferre estimated, Addax had paid Etete some $10 million in bribes. The biggest of these, $5 million, related to the purchase of the Ashland assets, which set off the company's rapid ascent in Nigeria.

Stolen Nigerian Assets in Switzerland

The Addax bribery affair was not the only instance of tainted Nigerian money ending up in Switzerland.

In 2000, Swiss financial authorities reprimanded Credit Suisse for accepting over $200 million in deposits from former Nigerian military ruler Sani Abacha's sons, although none of these accounts appeared in Suisse Secrets data.

Between 2005 and 2006, Swiss authorities repatriated $723 million that had been illicitly acquired by the family of General Abacha. Again in 2017, the Swiss authorities returned to Nigeria $321 million tied to the Abacha family.

Taking Ashland's Assets

In 1973, Ashland Nigeria Exploration Unlimited, a subsidiary of Ashland Inc., became the first company to enter into a so-called ""production-sharing contract"" with Nigeria's state-run oil company.

But in 1997, after nearly two and a half decades of operation, Ashland fell afoul of Nigerian authorities when it tried to sell shares in its Nigerian subsidiaries to a French company without getting government approval.

Mr Etete, the oil minister, had reportedly wanted to kill the Ashland contract, but Addax executives managed to convince him this would be bad publicity. Instead, Addax would negotiate with Ashland to buy out its Nigerian assets.

Addax secured Ashland's licenses for four oil fields in southeastern Nigeria in April 1998. The amount paid was not disclosed, but Ashland's earlier agreement with the French firm valued the assets at $60 million.

With the lucrative licenses in hand, Addax grew quickly. By 2005, it was Nigeria's largest independent oil producer, churning out over 65,000 barrels of crude per day and bringing in nearly $470 million a year in revenues.

The same year, Addax paid out $85 million in dividends to its shareholders, and shelled out another $50 million before its initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange closed in February 2006, valuing the company at over $2 billion. AOG also gave out about eight per cent of its remaining shares in Addax -- worth roughly $160 million at the time -- to current and former directors and employees.

As these windfalls were arriving for both AOG and Addax investors, a Credit Suisse account co-owned by eleven people -- including four AOG employees and various African political figures -- swelled in value. In March 2005, the account hit its maximum value of 62 million Swiss francs, worth about $53.32 million at the time.

Between March and April 2006, four new Credit Suisse accounts were opened in the names of the same eleven people. None reached more than 1 million Swiss francs in value, apart from one worth over 2.5 million francs in 2014.

Two accounts -- including the largest one -- were closed in 2009, the same year that Chinese state oil giant Sinopec bought Addax. A third was closed in 2013, while two others appeared to remain open well into the last decade.

Names on the Accounts

The five Credit Suisse accounts had eleven signatories, including four AOG employees and various political figures from West and Central Africa. OCCRP identified the following account holders:

Moustapha Niasse, Senegal's former foreign minister and national assembly president from 2012 to 2022. Niasse denied knowledge of these accounts but said he was a founding shareholder of AOG in 1987 and exited the company in 2006 after Addax was listed on Toronto Stock Exchange.

Maurice Nguesso, elder brother of president of Republic of the Congo, or Congo-Brazzaville. He did not respond to requests for comment.

Dominique Nimi Madingou, a Congolese politician. Madingou died last year.

Umaru Ali Shinkafi, a former Nigerian spy chief and presidential aspirant, whose son-in-law Atiku Bagudu was a key money launderer for Abacha.

Ahmed Kusamotu, a long time associate of Shinkafi, who was a political party chairman in early 1990s.

Abdoulaye Diao, a wealthy Senegalese oil merchant with close ties to the country's top political leaders. His son, Moussa Diao, is currently head of Oryx Energies, an AOG subsidiary.

Lourenco de Almeida, a trading manager with AOG until 2009.

Ali Kewe Ndiaye, a trader with AOG until 2009.

Mamadou Ciss, senior vice president at AOG until 2006.

Franklin Jackson, an AOG employee.

Shinkafi's Secret Share

The Nigerian spy boss Umaru Shinkafi, whose name has never been publicly connected to AOG or Addax, was a signatory to all five Credit Suisse accounts.

A former police officer, Mr Shinkafi became the head of the National Security Organization - now known as the State Security Service - in 1979. He held the post until about a month before the civilian government was ousted in a military coup in 1983.

Mr Shinkafi unsuccessfully ran in the primaries as a would-be presidential candidate under the National Republican Convention, one of two political parties approved by the military government to contest the 1993 presidential elections.

The elections, which Mr Shinkafi's party candidate eventually lost, were annulled by then President Ibrahim Babangida. Soon, General Abacha had re-taken military power. Mr Shinkafi's leadership dream was in tatters, but Nigeria's return to military rule produced another high-level connection for him. Mr Shinkafi's son-in-law, Atiku Bagudu, became a key money launderer for the Abachas, helping them clean billions, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Today, Mr Bagudu is governor of Nigeria's northwestern Kebbi State.

Mr Bagudu's second wife, Zainab, who is Mr Shinkafi's daughter, did not respond to requests for comment.

After Mr Abacha died in 1998, Nigerian authorities began looking into the money he and his associates had stolen. mr Shinkafi himself represented the Abachas in a negotiation with the government to return about $1.2 billion of stolen assets, according to a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable from 2002.

As Nigeria transitioned to democracy after Mr Abacha, Mr Shinkafi held onto the joint Credit Suisse accounts and ran for vice president during the 1999 presidential election. All the while, he was also accumulating shares in AOG. According to a share register obtained by OCCRP, Mr Shinkafi owned 500 of the company's ""class A"" shares in 2015, the year before he died.

AOG told OCCRP that Mr Shinkafi was an early minority shareholder and never owned more than 0.27 per cent of the company's shares. They said they were never aware of his association with Mr Abacha or his political activities.

""He was known to us as a businessman specialized in the oil and gas industry at that time and was not known to the group for his political activities,"" they wrote.

Tax Evasion Charges

In 2014, the past finally caught up with Addax when the Nigerian government under President Goodluck Jonathan accused the company of evading over $3 billion in taxes and royalty payments. Authorities demanded the firm pay back taxes stretching to 2000, just before then President Olusegun Obasanjo's administration granted the company special tax cuts.

Addax sued the Nigerian government in December 2014, arguing that as a result of receiving the tax cuts they had invested heavily in the Nigerian economy, amounting to even more than $3 billion.

For unclear reasons, Nigerian authorities agreed to settle the matter out of court and eventually agreed to abide by the earlier agreement. But this was not the end of Addax's troubles.

In 2016, Deloitte, Addax's auditor, reported the company had paid $100 million to lawyers, consultants, and other entities in Nigeria the previous year with no clear services or products rendered, according to a copy of a letter to Sinopec obtained by OCCRP.

Deloitte resigned as Addax auditor in December 2016 after the audit firm insisted on an external independent investigation into the payments. Swiss authorities later arrested Addax's chief executive officer and legal director in Geneva on bribery charges. Three weeks later, both were released without charge. A few months later, the company paid 31 million Swiss francs to settle the case.

In 2017, U.S. investigators opened their own probe into Addax's owner since 2009, the Chinese state firm Sinopec, since parts of the payment passed through the U.S., according to Bloomberg.

Then, last year, Nigeria's oil regulator revoked the four oil mining licenses Addax had obtained from Ashland, claiming they had failed to develop the assets for years. The president, Muhamadu Buhari, restored the licenses, ostensibly to protect the rule of law and a stable business environment, although some saw it as a move to avoid angering China.

Nevertheless, authorities continued to press their claim for back taxes. Today the government is still in court, demanding that Addax pay over $3 billion.",A|##O|##G|Fund|Joint|Secrets|A|##O|##G|Credit|Su|##isse|A|##O|##G|Ad|##da|##x|Petroleum|##fi|A|##O|##G|Ad|##da|##x|Petroleum|Ad|##da|##x|Ad|##da|##x|Ashland|Inc|Ad|O|Ad|Or|Group|##G|Ad|##x|
62,"Tether: Bitcoin inflation probe takes new turn; can USDT withstand the pressure
Tether [USDT] seems to have returned to hitting the rocks. In a new development, a New York court ordered Tether to provide its financial records to prove its innocence in a case that saw it cost crypto traders over $1 trillion.

In 2019, several crypto traders joined hands and prosecuted Tether and Bitfinex, its partner company, with allegations of market manipulation. The company was accused of inflating the Bitcoin [BTC] price for its own benefit.

“Don’t do it.” No, I will

Earlier, Tether had hoped to stop the Court from producing such judgment. In its defense, the company said the Court should reject the plaintiffs’ request because it was way “overboard” and unrelated to their claims.

However, it seemed Hon. Katherine Failla was not in favor of the defense talks and gave the go-ahead. The judgment meant Tether was to provide all its accounts across exchanges, including Poloniex, Bittrex, and Bitfinex. The judge said,

“The Court agrees that these issues should have been resolved at an earlier date. But it will not fully fault Plaintiffs where both sides knew there was disagreement. “

The good state remains

On USDT’s part, the update did not seem to affect the network negatively. According to Santiment, the 24-hour active addresses only declined a little from the number on 19 September. The addresses only dropped from 59,300 to 56,900 at press time.

As for its market cap, USDT remained relatively stable, while no significant dump was witnessed. In fact, its dominance over Circle [USDC] seemed to have increased further. With USDT’s market cap at $67.92 billion, the difference was over $17 billion.

Furthermore, while gauging the exchange netflow, CryptoQuant revealed a 1.75% increase in the last 24 hours. The exchange outflow was 695.952 million, while the inflow was 684.332. With this difference of 24.379 million, it might be agreed that more investors are increasingly choosing to remain in stablecoins.

Not only has USDT proved its strength in these areas, but it has also increased in circulation. Santiment data showed that the stablecoin’s one-day circulation increased tremendously from 19 September. At the time of this writing, the circulation was about 1.1 billion.

However, there has been no public response from the Tether team yet regarding the case. More so, it was unlikely that its defense team would re-counter the judgment since it had presented a rebuttal earlier.",Bit|##co|##in|USD|##T|Te|##ther|USD|##T|Te|##ther|Te|##ther|Bit|##fine|##x|Bit|##co|##in|BT|##C|Te|##ther|Court|Court|Te|##ther|Polo|##nie|##x|Bit|##tre|##x|Bit|##fine|##x|Court|Plain|##ti|USD|##T|Sant|##iment|USD|##T|Circle|USD|##C|USD|##T|Sant|

The Kurdistan Human Rights Network reported on Wednesday that Iran’s anti-riot forces killed a 55-year-old woman by the name of Minou Majidi during a protest rally held yesterday in Nobahar Street in Kermanshah, western Iran.

According to the report, Majidi’s body has been taken to the Department of Forensic Medicine and has not yet been handed over to her family.

In an interview with the state media, the Kermanshah Public Prosecutor confirmed that two people were killed and 25 injured during the protests in the city.

According to the statistics collected by the Kurdistan Human Rights Network (KHRN), seven protestors identified as Farjad Darvishi, Mohsen Mohammadi, Fereydoun Mahmoudi, Reza Lotfi, Zakariya Khiyal, Foad Ghadimi and Minou Majidi were killed by military forces during the protests against the killing of Mahsa (Zhina) Amini.

161 demonstrators were injured during the ongoing protests, while hundreds of people were arrested. Security forces used firearms, tear gas, water cannons and truncheons. People also continued to take to the streets in Tehran and numerous other cities in Iran. Women burned their headscarves, people shouted ""Death to dictatorship"", ""No Hajjis, no mullahs, death to Hezbollah"" and ""We don't want an Islamic republic"" as well as ""Jin Jiyan Azadî"" (Woman Life Freedom).

Jina Mahsa Amini was arrested by the religious police in Tehran on Tuesday last week because of her ""un-Islamic"" outfit. According to consistent media reports, the 22-year-old had not worn her hijab in accordance with the rules. She was therefore taken to a police station. According to the police, she ""suddenly developed heart problems"" and fell into a coma. Amini's family and eyewitnesses, who were also taken to the station, rejected this account and accused the police of beating the Kurdish woman, which eventually led to her death. Hospital records leaked by a hacker group and published by Iran International, a media outlet of the Iranian opposition in exile, with CT scans said to be of Jina Mahsa Amini, confirm the version according to which the young woman died from massive violence to the head. After her death, the Tehran clinic where Amini was treated also wrote in a post on Instagram, which has since been deleted, that she was already brain-dead when she was admitted on Tuesday.",Kurdistan|Human|Rights|Network|Department|of|For|##ens|##ic|Medicine|Kurdistan|Human|Rights|Network|K|##H|##R|##N|He|##z|##bol|##lah|Ji|A|Woman|Life|Freedom|International|

NEW YORK (AP) —

Walmart and Target plan to begin offering deals and price matching offers earlier this year to keep up with Americans pressed by soaring inflation and looking for ways to ease the potential sting of holiday shopping.

For two years now, shoppers have started preparing for the holidays early but last year it was because the global supply chain had been scrambled as nations began to emerge from the pandemic. This year, experts believe it is a rapid rise in prices, also tied to pandemic stricken economies, that will drive Americans to shop early to avoid prices that they believe could rise even further and to spread out the spending as they pay more for gasoline, food, and just about everything else.

The holiday sales strategies, announced on Thursday, come amid what is expected to be slower holiday sales growth compared with a year ago. AlixPartners, the global consulting firm, forecasts that holiday sales will be up anywhere from 4% to 7%, far below last year’s growth of 16%. The current inflation rate of 8.3% means retailers would see a decrease in real sales.

Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, is also expanding the window for returns by more than a month. Gift returns will now be accepted between Oct. 1 and Jan. 31, compared with last year’s return window of Nov. 1 to Jan. 24, the company said.

Walmart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, is offering a wider assortment of items this year with more new brands and more Walmart-exclusives than a year ago, according to Tom Ward, the company’s chief e-commerce officer. The company is deepening discounts on such items as toys, home goods, electronics and beauty. It said that more than half the toys on Walmart’s list of expected hot holiday toys are under $50 – with many under $25 — and nearly all of the toys are available to shop now or through pre-order on walmart.com.

Target, based in Minneapolis, said will begin offering holiday deals between Oct. 6 and Oct. 8, a few days earlier than a year ago and it will begin price matching then, also a couple days early.

Target has one of the most generous price-matching offers in retail, countering offers from more than two dozen other stores. That also applies to purchases at Target.com.

ADVERTISEMENT

Target plans to hire up to 100,000 seasonal employees in stores and distribution centers this holiday season, in line with a year ago.

Walmart is taking a more cautious hiring approach this year, saying this week that it would hire 40,000 U.S. workers for the holidays, a majority of them seasonal workers.

Last year, Walmart said it would hire roughly 150,000 new U.S. store workers, most of them permanent, full-time positions, on top of 20,000 permanent distribution and warehouse workers as the pandemic disrupted supply chains.

66,"Putin’s Address: Approaching the Precipice
Putin addressed Russia this morning, in a pre-recorded speech, pertaining to the ongoing Special Military Operation in Ukraine. The MSM headlines focus on the “Partial Mobilization” for Russian Reserve Military Specialists, and Putin’s threats to use “all weapon systems available”, which would include Nuclear Weapons of Mass Destruction. But there is SO MUCH MORE given to us in the speech. HUGE points that mainstream pundits are overlooking. Let’s get into it.

For Starters, if you have not read the translated transcript, you need to do that first. See here FULL TRANSCRIPT

Now that you’ve read Putin’s speech, let’s analyze the key passages and revelations.

“The subject of this address is the situation in Donbass and the course of the special military operation to liberate it from the neo-Nazi regime, which seized power in Ukraine in 2014 as the result of an armed state coup.”

Putin doesn’t beat around the bush. He comes out firing against the “Neo-Nazi regime” and the violent coup started in 2014. A coup that was facilitated by Obama and then Vice President Biden at the time. This is why Biden continues to send hundreds of billions of dollars to Ukraine. They are protecting their Deep State proxy.

This is why you see China and Russia in the news making joint statements about preventing “Western Colour Revolutions”. Russia are fighting back against the US proxy Ukraine, and now China looking to remove US influence in Taiwan. The East are standing up to the West.

However, you will notice throughout the speech, Putin carefully articulates that these actions were not carried out by any Nation(s) or the People, but by “the aggressive policy of some Western elites”.

Putin and Russia have made a conscious effort since the beginning, to direct their allegations and displeasure with the “Western elites”, not the US as a whole. Russia have repeatedly alleged that the “US Democratic Party”, along with the help of George Soros and non-government entities, have been laundering US DoD funds into Ukraine to build an unofficial Deep State proxy, outside the scope of US Congressional Oversight.

Putin goes on to say, “The goal of that part of the West is to weaken, divide and ultimately destroy our country.”

You’ll notice there is a distinction between the goals of the People, and the goals of the “Western elites”, specifically the DNC. You’ll also notice Putin has never said a negative thing about Trump throughout this entire situation.

Putin has clearly taken sides with Trump, and opposing “that part of the West”, i.e. the Deep State.

Putin goes on to address the horrific realities caused by the Western elites, using their influence to intentionally sow discord and chaos in the region since 2014. Turning the Ukrainian People into “cannon fodder”, and using military force on civilians, and organized “genocide”.

“They turned the Ukrainian people into cannon fodder and pushed them into a war with Russia, which they unleashed back in 2014. They used the army against civilians and organised a genocide, blockade and terror against those who refused to recognise the government that was created in Ukraine as the result of a state coup.”

All of the strife, death, disease, poverty, drug trafficking, human trafficking, civil war, etc., in Ukraine, has been a result of unnecessary US involvement in Ukraine. Putin is 100% correct here. And this disturbing reality is ignored by the Western media.

Putin clarifies that the reason for the Special Military Operation was a “preemptive measure”, as the West/NATO were looking to bring Nuclear Weapons into Ukraine, in addition to the weapons and activity already going on in Ukraine (Biolab network).

Putin goes on to address the methodical pace of the Military Operation. Clarifying that they are operating with intention to preserve human lives, and liberate the formerly Russian Donbas from the cruel Neo-Nazi regime. This puts several dents into the Western media narratives, that Putin and Russia were mindlessly killing civilians. Now the media claim the slow pace of Russia means that Ukraine are winning. This is folly. Russia recognize civilians on the battlefield, and are acting under the appropriate rules of engagement. The MSM and Big Tech are desperate to make sure you do not know this.

Putin goes on to clarify that they are not only fighting Ukraine, but the “entire military machine of the collective West.”

NATO and the US are pumping Ukraine with weapons, and supplying training to Ukrainian soldiers, using the blood of the Ukrainian people as their pawns of war. This is not a war between Russia and Ukraine, this is a proxy/economic war between the East and West. This is WW3.

And WW3 wouldn’t be complete without nuclear weapons right? Putin covered that base as well. After calling out the West for shelling the Zaporozhzhia Nuclear power plant, and looking to cause a Nuclear catastrophe, Putin declares he is ready to take on the threat of the West by whatever means necessary.

“I would like to remind those who make such statements regarding Russia that our country has different types of weapons as well, and some of them are more modern than the weapons NATO countries have. In the event of a threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to defend Russia and our people, we will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. This is not a bluff. The citizens of Russia can rest assured that the territorial integrity of our Motherland, our independence and freedom will be defended – I repeat – by all the systems available to us. Those who are using nuclear blackmail against us should know that the wind rose can turn around.”

You heard Putin right. Claiming Russia have advanced Nuclear weaponry that we don’t know about, and he is prepared to use “all weapon systems” available to him.

So whether you support Russia, Ukraine, or your head is firmly planted in the sand; this situation should have every single person’s attention on the planet.

Now, after analyzing the contents of the speech, look at it from 40,000 feet.

We are 6 weeks out from the midterms, all of Trump’s narratives have been proven true, Biden and the Deep State have run the country into the ground, the normies are waking up en masse, Deep State crimes being exposed and prosecuted as we speak, and now it APPEARS that the world is on the brink of nuclear fallout. If there was to be a “precipice”, surely this is it.

“We are on the brink of destruction, but it’s only on the brink, that people find the will to change. Only at the precipice, do we evolve.”

–The Day the Earth Stood Still

Keep in mind Putin has no quarrels with Trump. Meaning the only way this entire situation gets resolved, is if Trump reclaims the White House and puts and end to this, and holds the Deep State criminals accountable. The stage is set for Trump to come in and save the world from assured nuclear destruction.

Sounds pretty “biblical” to me.

67,"Facebook sued over illegal collection of user data
Mark Zuckerberg

AppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.

A class action suit has been filed against Meta, claiming that Facebook and Instagram iOS apps circumvented App Tracking Transparency in order to illegally continue tracking users without permission.

Since iOS 14, Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) requires apps to cease tracking users unless that user explicitly allows them to continue. Facebook has famously objected to ATT, and revealed that it has had an impact of more than $10 billion on its projected earnings.

According to Bloomberg, however, a proposed new class-action lawsuit claims that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta has been circumventing ATT and collecting data, regardless of user preferences and opt-out.

The suit, filed in San Francisco federal court, is based on research from data privacy researcher, and former Google engineer, Felix Krause. He claims that Facebook and Instagram inject JavaScript code into websites visited by users.

Krause says that this JavaScript code allows Meta to track ""anything you do on any website."" That goes further than the regular advertising tracking, and even theoretically includes the ability to capture passwords typed into sites.

The suit further alleges that Facebook opens web links in its own in-app browser, rather than using Safari or whatever the user's default browser is.

""This allows Meta to intercept, monitor and record its users' interactions and communications with third parties,"" says the suit. In doing so the suit also says that it also that data collected to boost advertising revenue, contrary to user preference.

Meta has not commented publicly on the suit. However, Krause's report says that the company acknowledged that it monitors browser activity, but denied the accusation of illegal data collection.",Facebook|Apple|##I|##ider|Met|##a|Facebook|In|##sta|##gram|A|Track|##ing|Trans|##par|##ency|Apple|Facebook|AT|Facebook|In|##sta|##gram|Met|##a|Google|Facebook|In|##sta|##gram|Met|##a|Facebook|Met|##a|Met|##a|
68,"Twitch Officially Bans All Gambling Streams
The broadcasting of real money dice, roulette, slot machines, and gambling-related activities have been restricted by Twitch.

The controversy erupted after Twitch broadcaster “ItsSliker” confessed to soliciting thousands of dollars in loans from viewers and other streamers without repaying them. Following calls from users such as Pokimane and others for the site to outlaw gambling, Twitch stepped up and took action, completely outlawing gambling broadcasts.

The organization has now retaliated by outlawing dice, slots, or roulette feeds. The restriction will be in place as of October 18, 2022.

An update on gambling on Twitch. pic.twitter.com/lckNTY9Edo — Twitch (@Twitch) September 20, 2022

ItsSliker has confessed to defrauding friends and followers of hundreds of thousands of dollars by fabricating claims of blocked bank accounts and other similar scams. The British streamer claimed that because of his enormous gambling debt, which he claims to have accumulated after getting into gambling via Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, he had to approach other users for loans but could not repay them.

The bans, however, are also expected to impact several other well-known broadcasters. Felix Lengyel and Tyler Faraz Niknam, two streamers, received sponsorship arrangements from Stake.com to broadcast their online gambling. In addition to providing victims their money back and assistance from Ludwig Ahgren, xQc has assisted individuals who ItsSliker’s scams have victimized.

The gambling problem has already been addressed by Twitch previously which amended its policy in 2021 to try to stop broadcasters from giving links or referral codes to websites with dice, slots, or roulette games. Gambling has continued to spread throughout the platform despite this,

An article from Bloomberg claims that gambling thrives on Twitch due to gambling firms paying broadcasters to engage in online gaming. Streamers like xQc frequently broadcast slots to an audience of up to 70,000 people and have partnerships with cryptocurrency gaming sites. This decision from Twitch will be decisive in putting an end to such activities; however, it could lead to a loss of audience.",T|##witch|T|##witch|Its|##S|##like|##r|T|##witch|T|##witch|##S|St|##ake|.|com|x|##Q|Its|##S|##like|##r|T|##witch|Bloomberg|
69,"Cardinals’ Kyler Murray reacts to fan incident in Vegas: ‘No hard feelings’
“Vegas is Vegas.”

Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray was allegedly struck with an open hand while celebrating with fans after his team’s 20-point comeback victory over the Raiders on Sunday.

The quarterback was high-fiving fans and getting hugs when a hand came down on his face from the second row.

Las Vegas police are investigating the matter, but Murray said he had no hard feelings for the individual.

“Stuff happens fast,” Murray told reporters Wednesday. “I know every person that I’ve hit in the face, I did it for a reason. I don’t know if he probably didn’t know where he was. I don’t know. It was a pretty live game. Vegas is Vegas. I’m sure he was having fun.

“But, again, I don’t think any player should be getting touched in that manner.”

Murray said he would even shake the individual’s hand.

“It is what it is.”

The Cardinals beat the Raiders on a walk-off fumble recovery returned for a touchdown by cornerback Byron Murphy Jr.

Murray was visibly amped, celebrating with teammates after the situation near the stands.

He said without a doubt he’d go up to the fans all over again in a similar situation.",Cardinals|Arizona|Cardinals|Raiders|Cardinals|Raiders|
70,"The record-setting DDoSes keep coming, with no end in sight
The record-vying distributed denial-of-service attacks keep coming, with two mitigation services reporting they encountered some of the biggest data bombardments ever by threat actors whose tactics and techniques are constantly evolving.

On Monday, Imperva said it defended a customer against an attack that lasted more than four hours and peaked at more than 3.9 million requests per second (RPS).

In all, the attackers directed 25.3 billion requests at the target with an average rate of 1.8 million RPS. While DDoSes exceeding 1 million RPS are growing increasingly common, they typically come in shorter bursts that measure in seconds or a few minutes at most.

A massive botnet

""[The] attackers used HTTP/2 multiplexing, or combining multiple packets into one, to send multiple requests at once over individual connections,"" Imperva's Gabi Stapel wrote. ""This technique can bring servers down using a limited number of resources, and such attacks are extremely difficult to detect.""

Stapel said that the attack likely would have peaked at an even higher rate had it not been countered by Akamai's mitigation service. The target of the DDoS was a Chinese telecommunications company that has come under attack before.

Advertisement

The attack originated with a botnet of routers, security cameras, and hacked servers connected to almost 170,000 different IP addresses. The IP addresses were located in more than 180 countries, with the US, Indonesia, and Brazil being the most common. Some of the botnet devices were hosted on various public clouds, including those offered by security service providers.

The arms race continues

Last week, Akamai said it recently defended a customer in Eastern Europe against a record-setting attack of 704.8 million packets per second. The same customer, Akamai said, had already set a record in July when it experienced a 659.6 Mpps DDoS from the same threat actor.

The latest attack sprayed packets at six global locations the target maintains, from Europe to North America.

""The attackers' command and control system had no delay in activating the multidestination attack, which escalated in 60 seconds from 100 to 1,813 IPs active per minute,"" Akamai's Craig Sparling wrote. ""Those IPs were spread across eight distinct subnets in six distinct locations. An attack this heavily distributed could drown an underprepared security team in alerts, making it difficult to assess the severity and scope of the intrusion, let alone fight the attack.""

DDoS attacks can be measured in several ways, including by the volume of data, the number of packets, or the number of requests sent each second. The current records include 3.4 terabits per second for volumetric DDoSes—which attempt to consume all bandwidth available to the target—809 million packets per second and 17.2 million RPS. The latter two records measure the power of application-layer attacks, which attempt to exhaust the computing resources of a target's infrastructure.

The ever-increasing numbers underscore the arms race between attackers and defenders as each attempt to outdo the other. These record-setting numbers aren't likely to stop any time soon.",I|##mper|##va|I|##mper|##va|##ap|##el|St|##ap|##el|A|##ka|##ma|##i|A|##ka|##ma|##i|

KARACHI: The Customs Court has rejected the bail plea of the accused involved in the illegal registration of a Bentley car, stolen from London and smuggled to Karachi, ARY News reported on Wednesday.

The court pronounced the reserved verdict on a petition filed by an accused Naveed Yamin, seeking bail in a Bentley car recovery case.

However, the court accepted the bail plea of another accused Jameel Sheikh in the luxury car. The Customs Court has directed him to submit surety bonds of Rs2mn for availing the relief.

The case

The Collectorate of Customs Enforcement (CCE), Karachi on Sep 3. seized luxury vehicle ‘Bentley Mulsanne,’ which was stolen from London, United Kingdom.

74,"How the new bivalent Covid vaccines work
France became the latest country on Tuesday to authorise new Covid-19 vaccines that have been updated to target Omicron subvariants ahead of autumn booster campaign.

Here’s what you need to know about these “bivalent” vaccines, which means they also still target the original strain that emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in 2019.

– Mutating to evade immunity –

Two of the first vaccines developed to fight the original strain were made by the US-German team of Pfizer-BioNTech and by US firm Moderna, both using new mRNA technology.

While traditional vaccines use a weakened or inactivated germ to prepare the body for a future attack from the real virus, mRNA deploys snippets of genetic material that carry instructions showing the body’s cells how to produce a protein — in this case, Covid’s famous spike protein.

The body’s immune system then triggers antibodies to fight off that spike protein, making it ready for when the real coronavirus comes knocking.

However, the Covid virus has mutated throughout the pandemic, growing new spikes to help it evade the immune response built up by the original vaccines.

The Omicron variant, which has milder symptoms but is more infectious, has become dominant across the world this year — particularly in recent months its subvariants BA.4 and BA.5.

Vaccine makers have been racing to catch up, aiming to provide updated booster shots ahead of an expected new wave of Covid cases in the northern hemisphere’s winter.

– Aiming for BA.4 and BA.5 –

Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna first tweaked their original vaccines to include the spike protein seen in the BA.1 subvariant, while also still targeting the original strain.

Then both vaccines were further tweaked to include the spike proteins on the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.

The US Food and Drug Administration approved both BA.4/5 vaccines late last month, and officials there hope millions of Americans will receive bivalent boosters throughout September.

The European Union’s medicines watchdog EMA approved Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech’s BA.1 vaccines at the start of this month.

The EMA then approved Pfizer-BioNTech’s BA.4/5 last week, saying its recommendation was based on clinical data from the older BA.1 version.

Canada meanwhile authorised Moderna’s BA.1 vaccine at the start of September.

Clinical trial data remains sparse for the newest BA.4/5 vaccines, which the US approved based on animal studies showing they produced a greater immune response and lowered levels of the virus in the lungs, compared to older shots.

Antoine Flahault, director of the Institute of Global Health at the University of Geneva, said he was “still not convinced” about the superior efficacy of the BA.4/5 vaccines because there had not yet been clinical trials into their effectiveness.

However, the vaccines are “very promising” and have no new safety concerns, Flahault told AFP, adding that there would be much more data in the coming weeks as the US bivalent booster campaign gains steam.

The concept of adapting a new vaccine without carrying out full clinical trials every time is not a new one.

Influenza vaccines are updated annually, and are now quadrivalent, targeting components of two influenza A and two influenza B viruses.

US health officials have said that in the future newly updated Covid boosters could be recommended every year, similar to influenza vaccines — unless drastically different variants emerge.

– Other bivalent vaccines –

On Tuesday France’s National Authority for Health gave the green light for three bivalent vaccines — Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech’s jabs targeting BA.1, as well as Pfizer’s against BA.4/5.

The French health authority recommended that those at risk of severe disease or caregivers get any one of the three vaccines as soon as they become available as part of an autumn booster campaign.

France has already ordered several million doses of bivalent vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, the health ministry told AFP.

There are already signs of a Covid resurgence in France, where the number of cases jumped by more than 65 percent last week after two months of decline.

Other vaccine makers are working on bivalent jabs, including one from France’s Sanofi and Britain’s GSK that targets the earlier Delta and Beta strains.

The EMA is reviewing that vaccine as well as another from the Spanish pharma firm HIPRA targeting the Alpha and Beta strains.

77,"Cambodia Raises Minimum Wage For Garment Factory Workers For 2023
PHNOM PENH, Sept 22 (NNN-AKP) – Cambodia set a new monthly minimum wage for workers in the country’s garment, footwear and travel goods sector, at some 200 U.S. dollars from 2023, up 3.09 percent from the current level of 194 U.S. dollars, Labour Minister, Ith Samheng, said.

The announcement came after the National Council for Minimum Wage voted on a minimum wage of about 198 U.S. dollars per month for next year, which was then added by two U.S. dollars by the government.

The 51 council members include representatives of the government, the manufacturers’ group, and the trade union.

“Today (yesterday), the National Council for Minimum Wage decided on the monthly minimum wage of 198 dollars, and Cambodian Prime Minister, Samdech Techo Hun Sen, added another two dollars, so the monthly minimum wage for the garment, footwear and travel goods industry for 2023 is 200 dollars,” Samheng told reporters after the vote.

“This new minimum wage will take effect from Jan 1, 2023,” he added.

Besides wage, workers in the garment, footwear and travel goods sector will also receive other fringe benefits of 21-32 U.S. dollars per month, for regular attendance, transportation, rent and seniority bonus, the minister said.

“This is a good sign for our workers, and I believe that the wage hike will contribute further to improving the livelihoods of our workers,” he said.

Garment, footwear and travel goods sector is the largest foreign exchange earner for the country. It involves about 1,100 factories and branches, with approximately 750,000 workers, mostly females.

Nang Sothy, co-chair of the Government-Private Working Group on Industrial Relations, said, employers were pleased to raise workers’ wage despite difficulties facing them, due in part to the Ukraine crisis.

“The six-dollar increase will not make a big change to the livelihoods of our workers, because of rising inflation, but we hope it will help ease their hardships,” he said.

Meanwhile, Sothy urged workers to work harder to increase productivity, so as to boost competitiveness in the sector.

Pav Sina, president of the Collective Union of Movement of Workers, which represents more than 50,000 workers, said, although the wage hike failed to meet the union’s demand of 215 U.S. dollars, it was a positive step towards improving the workers’ livelihoods.

“The new minimum wage is acceptable,” he told reporters.

Friday, Oct. 7 (Tokyo time)

11:00 a.m. U.S. President Joe Biden says the risk of nuclear ""Armageddon"" is at the highest level since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, after Russian officials spoke of the possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons after suffering massive setbacks in the invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at a fundraiser for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""a guy I know fairly well"" and was ""not joking when he talks about the use of tactical nuclear weapons or biological or chemical weapons."" Biden added, ""We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis."" He suggested the threat from Putin is real ""because his military is -- you might say -- significantly underperforming.""

8:00 a.m. Russian missiles hit apartment buildings in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia on Thursday, leaving at least seven people dead and five missing in a region that Moscow has illegally annexed, the regional governor said. Two strikes damaged more than 40 buildings hours after Ukraine's president announced that his military had retaken three more villages in another of the four regions annexed by Russia. Gov. Oleksandr Starukh said more than 20 people had been rescued from the buildings.

5:55 a.m. Two Russian nationals have sought asylum in the U.S. after sailing to an island in Alaska, the state's U.S. senators say.

The Russians landed at a beach near Gambell on the northwest tip of St. Lawrence Island, according to a news release.

Only local and state authorities had the capability to respond immediately, while ""Customs and Border Protection had to dispatch a Coast Guard aircraft from over 750 miles away to get on scene,"" Sen. Lisa Murkowski says.

Sen. Dan Sullivan says the incident makes it clear that ""the Russian people don't want to fight Putin's war of aggression"" and that ""our state has a vital role to play in securing America's national security.""

Republicans Murkowski and Sullivan push for the administration of President Joe Biden, a Democrat, to strengthen American military capabilities in the Arctic.

5:45 a.m. International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi has held ""a positive and constructive meeting"" with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv, discussing the Russian-held, Ukrainian-operated Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the IAEA says.

The talk also covered Grossi's proposed nuclear safety and security protection zone around the plant. Grossi and Zelenskyy agreed to meet again after Grossi visits Russia.

""This is a particularly dangerous moment for the safety and security"" of the plant, Grossi says in the IAEA news release, referring to demands that workers there sign on with Russian state nuclear energy company Rosatom. ""Staff at the plant are being forced to make a hugely difficult decision for themselves and their loved ones. The enormous pressure they are facing must stop.""

The IAEA team at the plant has also reported shelling in an industrial area close to the access road.

12:30 a.m. The head of the International Monetary Fund warns of a ""darkening"" global economic outlook for next year, blaming ""multiple shocks"" including the ""senseless"" war in Ukraine.

""We estimate that countries accounting for about one-third of the world economy will experience at least two consecutive quarters of contraction this or next year,"" Kristalina Georgieva says in a speech ahead of the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. ""And, even when growth is positive, it will feel like a recession because of shrinking real incomes and rising prices.""

In addition to the war, the IMF managing director also blames the COVID-19 pandemic and climate disasters for ""driving a global surge in prices, especially on food and energy, causing a cost-of-living crisis.""

""Far from being transitory, inflation has become more persistent,"" Georgieva says. ""High energy and food prices, tighter financial conditions and lingering supply constraints decelerated growth.""

9:40 p.m. The Russian-installed deputy head of the annexed Kherson region of Ukraine suggests that Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu should shoot himself because of failures in the Ukraine conflict.

""Indeed, many say: If they were a defense minister who had allowed such a state of affairs, they could, as officers, have shot themselves,"" Kirill Stremousov says in a video message reported by Reuters, while also defending Russian soldiers. ""Let's say this: The Ministry of Defense does not only consist of ministers, generals, corrupt marauders and other various scum, but all those heroes who gave their lives today, who stand to the end.""

5:30 a.m. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukrainian forces have retaken more settlements in Kherson, one of the partially Russian-occupied southern regions that Moscow claims to have annexed. With Russian forces retreating from front lines in the south and east, Zelenskyy said in a late-night video address that Novovoskresenske, Novohryhorivka and Petropavlivka, northeast of the city of Kherson, had been ""liberated.""

1:50 p.m. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said its military had made major, rapid advances against Russian forces in the past week, taking back dozens of towns in regions in the south and east that Russia has declared annexed. ""This week alone, since the Russian pseudo-referendum, dozens of population centers have been liberated. These are in Kherson, Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk regions,"" he said in a Tuesday night address.

11:04 a.m. The Japanese government said it will reopen its embassy in Kyiv on Wednesday following a seven-month closure triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Staff at the embassy had been transferred to a temporary liaison office in the western city of Lviv in March. But as Russia's invasion intensified, they left Ukraine later that month. By reopening the embassy, Japan aims to enhance coordination with other Group of Seven nations in areas such as reconstruction assistance for Ukraine. Six other G-7 members -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and the United States -- reopened their embassies before summer.

3:16 a.m. The head of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, who was detained over the weekend in what Ukraine called a Russian act of terror, will not return to that job, the U.N. nuclear watchdog said. Ukraine said a Russian patrol detained Ihor Murashov on Friday as he traveled from Europe's largest nuclear power plant to the town of Enerhodar, where many of the plant's staff live.

10:30 a.m. Russia's retreat from a key Ukrainian city over the weekend elicited outcry from an unlikely crowd -- state-run media outlets that typically cast Moscow's war in glowing terms.

6:00 a.m. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is drawing the wrath of Ukrainians including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy with tweets urging Kyiv to seek a negotiated solution to the invasion by Russia and to permanently cede Crimea.

Musk, the world's richest person, proposed United Nations-supervised elections in the four partly occupied regions that Moscow moved to annex after what it called referendums. The votes have been denounced by Ukraine and Western governments as illegal and coercive.

""Russia leaves if that is will of the people,"" Musk wrote in his Twitter poll.

Zelenskyy responded with his own Twitter poll asking followers whether they prefer an Elon Musk who supports Ukraine or one who supports Russia.

3:50 a.m. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said on Monday that his three teenage sons are ready to join Russia's ""special military operation,"" what Moscow calls its invasion of Ukraine.

The new post comes days after Kadyrov appeared to scold Russia for its military setbacks in Ukraine, saying more drastic measures were needed -- such as using low-grade nuclear weapons.

9:54 p.m. Ukrainian forces achieve their biggest breakthrough in the south of the country since the war began, bursting through the front and advancing rapidly along the Dnieper River on Monday, threatening supply lines for thousands of Russian troops.

Kyiv gave no confirmation of the gains, but Russian sources acknowledge that a Ukrainian tank offensive advanced dozens of kilometers along the river's west bank, recapturing villages. The breakthrough mirrors recent Ukrainian successes in the east that have turned the tide in the war against Russia, even as Moscow raises the stakes by annexing territory, ordering mobilization and threatening nuclear retaliation.

6:40 p.m. The Kremlin on Monday said it favored a ""balanced approach"" to the issue of nuclear weapons, not based on emotion, after a key ally of President Vladimir Putin called over the weekend for Russia to use a ""low-yield nuclear weapon"" in Ukraine. Asked about the comments by Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of the Chechnya region, who also criticized Russia's military leadership over battlefield setbacks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Kadyrov had the right to voice his opinion, but that Russia's military approach should not be driven by emotions.

5:30 p.m. Prominent Russian journalist Ksenia Sobchak faces a criminal investigation over a story that police suspect was ""fake,"" state news agency TASS reports, citing an unidentified source in law enforcement. Sobchak, whose late father was the mayor of St. Petersburg in the 1990s and worked closely with Vladimir Putin, hosts a YouTube channel with over 3 million subscribers. She also founded a popular Telegram account which regularly shares stories critical of Russia's mobilization efforts. TASS reports that Sobchak's story related to ""state funding of festivals"" and that she could be charged under an article of Russian law that provides for three-year jail sentences.

2:00 p.m. The military commissar of Russia's Khabarovsk region was removed from his post after half of newly mobilized personnel were sent home because they did not meet the draft criteria, says Mikhail Degtyarev, the governor of the region in Russia's Far East. Russia's first mobilization since World War II, declared by President Vladimir Putin on Sept. 21, has led to widespread discontent among officials and citizens over the way the draft has been handled, including complaints about enlistment officers sending call-up papers to clearly ineligible men. The governor said the removal of the commissar, Yuri Laiko, would not affect the mobilization plan set by Putin.

9:30 a.m. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukraine's forces have liberated the small settlements of Arkhanhelske and Myrolyubivka in the Kherson region.

2:50 a.m. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's chief adviser, Ibrahim Kalin, in Istanbul on Sunday, the White House says.

They discussed ""progress on NATO accession for Finland and Sweden"" and their mutual ""condemnation of Russia's attempted, illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory."" The meeting was not announced beforehand.

Ankara opposes Western sanctions on Russia and has close ties with both Moscow and Kyiv, its Black Sea neighbors. But Turkey also has criticized Russia's invasion and sent armed drones to Ukraine.

12:01 a.m. Ukraine's recapture of Lyman, a city within the area of Russian President Vladimir Putin's declared annexation, shows that ""Ukrainians are making progress, are able to push back the Russian forces,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says in an interview Sunday with NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

Stoltenberg cites ""the advanced weapons that the United States and other allies are providing"" and says the best way to counter Russia's proclaimed annexation of parts of Ukraine is to continue supporting the government in Kyiv.

NATO supports the investigation into the apparent sabotage of Russia's Nord Stream pipelines under the Baltic Sea, he says, while noting that Ukraine's application for accelerated membership in the alliance requires agreement by ""all 30 allies.""

Sunday, Oct. 2

5:00 a.m. The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog will travel to Kyiv and Moscow next week as the situation around Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant remains tense, the International Atomic Energy Agency says in a statement.

Director General Rafael Grossi ""continues his consultations and other efforts aimed at agreeing and implementing a nuclear safety and security zone around [Zaporizhzhia] as soon as possible.""

The IAEA also says Grossi is aware that the Ukrainian chief of the plant, Ihor Murashov, has been ""temporarily"" detained by Russia. ""Such a detention of any member of the plant staff would be a source of grave concern in itself, but also for its psychological impact and pressure on the rest of the staff -- which is detrimental to nuclear safety and security,"" Grossi is quoted as saying.

4:00 a.m. Gas outflows from the leaking Nord Stream 2 pipeline have stopped, according to a spokesperson for the operator, who says the pipeline is either empty or has reached a pressure equilibrium with the water outside.

Methane had been escaping from the Baltic Sea pipeline for days since leaks were discovered, producing a huge raft of bubbles at the surface.

Denmark's prime minister says: ""The damage to Nord Stream is not accidental and must be thoroughly investigated.""

Saturday, Oct. 1

11:50 p.m. The head of the Russian region of Chechnya says Moscow should consider using a low-yield nuclear weapon in Ukraine after suffering a major new battlefield setback in Lyman.

""In my personal opinion, more drastic measures should be taken, right up to the declaration of martial law in the border areas and the use of low-yield nuclear weapons,"" says Ramzan Kadyrov, who has been called ""Putin's attack dog,"" in a Telegram message.

11:30 p.m. Russia's Defense Ministry says Russian troops have withdrawn from the embattled town of Lyman under ""threat of encirclement.""

The town in eastern Ukraine has served as an important logistics hub for the Russian invasion. The Ukrainian side claims to have the Russian forces surrounded.

5:30 p.m. Ukraine has encircled Russia's forces around a bastion that is critical for Moscow at the eastern town of Lyman, in an operation that is still underway, Reuters reports.

A Ukrainian military spokesperson is quoted as saying that Russia's forces at Lyman totaled around 5,000 to 5,500 soldiers, but the number of encircled troops may have fallen because of casualties and some soldiers trying to break out of the encirclement.

7:00 a.m. Russian athletes who do not support the war should be allowed to compete again, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach tells Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, after floating the idea of a neutral flag for those who distance themselves from their government.

4:49 a.m. Ukraine's military had achieved ""significant results"" in the east, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says, reports Reuters.

Ukraine's Defense Ministry said earlier its troops had captured the village of Drobysheve, some 10 km to the northwest of Lyman, in the eastern Donetsk region.

Meanwhile, a resolution introduced by the U.S. and Albania at the United Nations Security Council condemning Russia's attempted annexation of parts of Ukraine was rejected after Russia exercised its veto.

The Treasury Department is imposing sanctions on 14 people in Russia's military-industrial complex, two leaders of the country's central bank, family members of top officials and 278 members of Russia's legislature ""for enabling Russia's sham referenda and attempt to annex sovereign Ukrainian territory.""

12:50 a.m. Putin says the West was ""satanic"" and rejected ""moral norms"" in a combative speech delivered from the Kremlin.

He attacked the West's liberalism, saying that, unlike Russia, it had turned away from ""faith and traditional values.""

12:36 a.m. ""We will never recognize these purported annexations, nor the sham 'referenda' conducted at gunpoint,"" says a statement from the foreign ministers of the Group of Seven -- Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K., the U.S. and the European Union.

""We will impose further economic costs on Russia, and on individuals and entities -- inside and outside of Russia -- that provide political or economic support to these violations of international law,"" it added.

12:24 a.m. The U.S. says that it ""condemns Russia's fraudulent attempt"" to annex sovereign Ukrainian territory.

10:08 p.m. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida tweets that ""Japan strongly condemns Russia's 'incorporation' of the regions in Ukraine.""

""It infringes upon Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, constitutes a violation of international law, and shall never be recognized,"" he adds.

10:02 p.m. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, calls Russia's annexation of four Ukrainian regions illegal and says that occupied land would remain part of Ukraine.

""The illegal annexation proclaimed by Putin won't change anything,"" von der Leyen tweets.

9:32 p.m. In a speech in the Kremlin, Russian President Vladimir Putin announces the annexation of four Ukrainian regions that Moscow's forces have partially seized during the seven-month conflict. This follows what Russia called referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine.

5:30 p.m. Russia's top spy said Moscow had materials that indicated the West had a role in ruptures to the undersea Nord Stream pipelines that have threatened to put them permanently out of use, Russian news agencies report.

4:00 p.m. At least 23 people were killed and 28 wounded in a Russian missile strike that hit a convoy of vehicles carrying civilians near the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, the regional governor says. A Reuters witness saw about 12 bodies, four of them in cars, and said a missile had left a crater in the ground near two lines of vehicles at a car market. ""So far, 23 dead and 28 wounded. All civilians,"" Oleksandr Starukh, the Zaporizhzhia regional governor, wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

10:40 a.m. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin says it is still too soon to speculate who might have been behind the Nord Stream pipeline ruptures. ""In terms of the attack, or the damage to the pipeline, at this point I think there's a lot of speculation. But quite frankly, until a complete investigation is done, no one will be able to really determine for certain what happened,"" Austin told a news conference in Hawaii. He added that he had discussed the incident with his Danish counterpart on Wednesday, ""and he pointed out to me that it will be several days before he's able to get the right team in to look at the sites and really try to determine as best as possible what happened.""

6:39 a.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday signed decrees paving the way for the occupied Ukrainian regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia to be formally annexed into Russia.

3:40 a.m. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the ""sham"" referendums on the status of Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine ""are a futile effort to mask what amounts to a further attempt at a land grab.""

""The United States does not, and will never, recognize the legitimacy or outcome of these sham referenda or Russia's purported annexation of Ukrainian territory,"" Blinken says in a statement ahead of Friday's expected start of the annexation process by Russian President Vladimir Putin's pen.

2:00 a.m. A move by Russia to annex more Ukrainian regions would be a ""dangerous escalation"" that ""has no place in the modern world,"" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says, adding that the economic pain would be felt worldwide.

""Any decision to proceed with the annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine would have no legal value and deserves to be condemned,"" Guterres told reporters.

""Any decision by Russia to go forward will further jeopardize the prospects for peace,"" he says. ""It will prolong the dramatic impacts on the global economy, especially developing countries, and hinder our ability to deliver life-saving aid across Ukraine and beyond.""

Thursday, Sept. 29

11:30 p.m. Fixing leaks on the undersea Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines may take more than six months, a Russian lawmaker is quoted as saying.

TASS reports that Pavel Zavalny, who heads the State Duma's Committee on Energy, said two options for repairs are lowering a caisson down to the pipes or raising them by crane.

Hoisting the pipes up ""may take a long time; it's not a month or two, it's six months or a year, at least,"" Zavalny says.

9:30 p.m. President Vladimir Putin will sign documents on Friday proclaiming Russia's annexation of four Ukrainian regions -- Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk -- as Moscow rushes to hold on to territorial claims against a stunning Ukrainian counteroffensive.

The move, announced by Putin's spokesman, looks likely to further isolate Putin's Russia.

The U.S. and the European Union are set to impose additional sanctions on Russia over the annexation, which follows what Kyiv and Western countries say were illegal referendums staged at gunpoint on Russian-held Ukrainian territory. Even some of Russia's close traditional allies, such as Serbia and Kazakhstan, say they will not recognize the annexation.

A treaty signing ceremony with representatives of the four regions on Friday is expected to be followed by legislation in the Russian parliament to formally annex the territories. Preparations for the ceremony have been underway in Moscow. Read more.

But this reserve road base in central Finland went unused for decades, as it is the main highway connecting Helsinki to the more northern parts of the country.

Zelenskyy, who got along famously with Truss's predecessor Boris Johnson, says after talks with the new prime minister: ""We expect London's leadership in reaction to Russian sham referenda as well.""

""Defense and financial aid to Ukraine must be enhanced in response,"" the president adds in a Twitter post.

Truss ""made clear that the U.K. would never recognize Russian attempts to annex sovereign territory,"" the prime minister's office says in a statement. ""She reiterated that Ukraine could depend on the U.K.'s support until President Putin was defeated.""

12:30 a.m. As U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping move toward a possible first face-to-face meeting in November, former Obama administration diplomat Robert Hormats says the two leaders should identify a few key areas where they can cooperate -- such as the global economy and climate change.

""I think the president will want to get a view from President Xi as to what kind of support he intends to give the general notion of Russia's policy, over the next several months and years, and make it clear that the United States does not support [that], and encourages China not to support anything that will have to do with supporting the Russians in Ukraine,"" Hormats tells Nikkei in an interview.

""Russia's sham referenda, if accepted, will open a Pandora's box that we cannot close,"" she says. And if Russia vetoes the resolution, ""we will then look to the U.N. General Assembly to send an unmistakable message to Moscow.""

3:45 a.m. Latvia's defense minister has called for an investigation into the Nord Stream gas pipeline leaks, describing the incident as a diversion that took place close to NATO territory.

Tuesday, Sept. 27

11:00 p.m. Leaks on two Russian natural gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea have European officials talking of possible sabotage against the vital arteries for energy.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said sabotage could not be ruled out as the cause of the leaks on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, the Financial Times reports.

""There are three leaks, and therefore it is difficult to imagine that it could be accidental,"" the prime minister says.

Danish defense authorities have released photos showing an area of gas bubbles in the sea. The pipelines were not operating, so the leaks have no direct impact on gas flows to Europe for now. But they highlight the precariousness of the continent's energy supply as winter approaches.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that no possibility could be excluded when he was asked whether sabotage caused the leaks, Interfax reports.

7:05 p.m. Kazakhstan will welcome Russians fleeing conscription, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev says, signaling an indirect condemnation of the invasion of Ukraine by one of Moscow's closest economic and political partners.

Kazakhstan's Interior Ministry says 98,000 Russians have crossed into the country since Sept. 21, when President Vladimir Putin announced a conscription drive to bolster his forces in Ukraine.

5:46 p.m. A total of 231 ships with 5.3 million tonnes of agricultural products on board have left Ukraine so far under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to unblock Ukrainian sea ports, the Ukrainian Infrastructure Ministry says. Ukraine's grain exports slumped after Russia invaded the country on Feb. 24 and blockaded its Black Sea ports, driving up global food prices and prompting fears of shortages in Africa and the Middle East. Three Black Sea ports were reopened under a deal signed on July 22 by Moscow and Kyiv.

5:23 p.m. Refugees arriving from Ukraine have helped drive Germany's population to its highest level, the Federal Statistical Office says, with more than 84 million people now living in the European Union's most populous country. Germany has one of the world's lowest fertility rates, and by some measures its most aged population. In a report issued on Tuesday, the Federal Statistics Office said that the population had grown by 1%, or 843,000 people, in the first half of 2022. The population grew just 0.1% over the whole of 2021. Germany recorded net immigration of 750,000 people from Ukraine over the same period.

3:00 p.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely to announce the accession of occupied regions of Ukraine to the Russian Federation during his address to parliament on Sept. 30, the British Ministry of Defense says. The referendums currently underway within these territories are scheduled to conclude on Sept. 27, the ministry said in its daily briefing on Twitter. ""Russia's leaders almost certainly hope that any accession announcement will be seen as a vindication of the special military operation and will consolidate patriotic support for the conflict,"" it said.

12:45 p.m. Japan lodges a protest with Russia over the detention of a Japanese consular official on espionage allegations, denying the allegations and accusing Russian authorities of abusive interrogation.

Monday, Sept. 26

7:30 a.m. A right-wing alliance led by Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy party was on course for a clear majority in the next parliament, giving the country its most right-wing government since World War II. Meloni, as leader of the largest coalition party, was also likely to become Italy's first woman prime minister. Meloni, 45, has played down her party's post-fascist roots and portrays it as a mainstream conservative group. She has pledged to support Western policy on Ukraine and not take undue risks with the third-largest economy in the eurozone.

4:00 a.m. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accuses Washington of ""playing with fire"" regarding Taiwan in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly.

""They're playing with fire around Taiwan. On top of that, they're promising military support to Taiwan,"" he says.

3:47 a.m. Four Russian-held regions of Ukraine kick off referendums on joining Russia, a Kremlin-backed effort largely considered a precursor to their annexation. Voting in the regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia is expected to last until Tuesday.

""Based on the evidence gathered by the Commission, it has concluded that war crimes have been committed in Ukraine,"" Erik Mose, who heads the Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva.

In a state media report Thursday, an unnamed North Korean defense official told the U.S. to stop making ""reckless remarks"" and to ""keep its mouth shut."" Biden administration officials earlier this month confirmed a declassified U.S. intelligence assessment that Russia was in the process of purchasing arms from North Korea, including millions of artillery shells and rockets, as Moscow attempts to ease severe supply shortages in Ukraine worsened by U.S.-led export controls and sanctions. The North Korean statement came weeks after Moscow described the U.S. intelligence finding as ""fake.""

""This is why we will not accept any peace dictated by Russia and this is why Ukraine must be able to fend off Russia's attack,"" Scholz said. The return of imperialism, with Putin's war on Ukraine, was not just a disaster for Europe but for the global, rules-based peace order, the chancellor said. He called on the U.N. to defend this from those who would prefer a world where the ""strong rule the weak.""

""What Russia is doing in Donetsk, Luhansk and other occupied territories of Ukraine is a parody of democracy. It's an attempt to cover the true face of the totalitarian regime,"" Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda says, according to a spokesperson.

Russian-installed officials in the southern Kherson region, where Moscow's forces control around 95% of the territory, say they also will hold a referendum.

Taiwan has donated more than $30 million for humanitarian relief, mostly raised from the public, and joined in Western-led sanctions against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.

79,"Trump, three of his children sued for fraud

Trump lawyer Alina Habba dismissed the allegations as politically motivated, saying in a statement that the attorney general’s claims are “meritless”…writes Ashe O

Former President Donald Trump and three of his grown-up children and executives at his company have been sued by the New York Attorney General Letitia James on Wednesday for “flagrantly manipulating property valuations to deceive lenders, insurance brokers and tax authorities into giving them better rates on bank loans and insurance policies and to reduce their tax liability.”

In a 222-page civil law suit, James sought the New York Supreme Court to bar Trump, as well as Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump, from serving as executives at any company in New York, and to bar the Trump Organization from acquiring any commercial real estate or receiving loans from any New York-registered financial institution for five years, the Washington Post reported.

It seeks to recover more than $250 million in what James’s office says are ill-gotten gains received through the alleged deceptive practices. While the lawsuit itself is not a criminal prosecution, James (D) said she has referred possible violations of federal law to the Justice Department and the IRS, the report said.

Trump lawyer Alina Habba dismissed the allegations as politically motivated, saying in a statement that the attorney general’s claims are “meritless”.

The lawsuit, filed in New York Supreme Court, is the result of a more than two-year investigation by James and names 23 properties in the Trump Organization portfolio, including his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida, his Seven Springs estate in Westchester County, New York, and the D.C. hotel he leased from the federal government until he sold it in May.

“The inflated asset valuations in the Statements cannot be brushed aside or excused as merely the result of exaggeration or good faith estimation about which reasonable real estate professionals may differ,” it says.

Trump faces more than 18 months after he left the White House and at a time when he remains actively involved in Republican politics and has broadly suggested he will run for president again in 2024. In addition to naming Trump and three of his children personally, the suit names the Trump Organization and Allen Weisselberg, Trump’s longtime Chief Financial Officer (CFO) who recently pleaded guilty to tax crimes, and financial controller Jeffrey McConney.

Trump and his attorneys have dismissed James’s inquiry as politically motivated and have repeatedly said that Trump and his family have done nothing illegal in operating their businesses. Pointing to statements James made on the campaign trail in which she promised to investigate him, Trump has coined her investigation a “witch hunt”.

“Today’s filing is neither focused on the facts nor the law – rather, it is solely focused on advancing the Attorney General’s political agenda,” Alina Habba, one of Trump’s lawyers, said in a statement on Wednesday morning. “We are confident that our judicial system will not stand for this unchecked abuse of authority, and we look forward to defending our client against each and every one of the Attorney General’s meritless claims.”

Defence attorneys have said in court that commercial real estate firms routinely argue for lower tax appraisals and that the company’s conduct was no different, but James said Wednesday that the misstated valuations cannot be brushed as a “good faith mistake”. The former president and his family should be held to the same standards as everyday Americans, James said at a news conference in Manhattan, noting that it is illegal for people to lie to banks in order to secure loans to send their children to college or get a home mortgage.

“Claiming you have money that you do not have does not amount to the art of the deal. It’s the art of the steal,” James said, mocking the title of Donald Trump’s 1987 book. “There cannot be different rules for different people in this country or in this state.”

80,"US unearths largest-ever Covid relief fraud

The suspects are alleged to have issued bills for meals they did not serve to children who did not exist, according to the Department of Justice (DoJ)…reports Asian Lite News

US prosecutors have charged 47 people in connection with the largest ever Covid-19 relief fraud scheme, with the suspects accused of stealing a whopping $250 million from a government aid programme that was supposed to feed children in need during the health crisis.



In a statement on Tuesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray said this “egregious plot” was the largest of its kind uncovered so far, the BBC reported.



The suspects are alleged to have issued bills for meals they did not serve to children who did not exist, according to the Department of Justice (DoJ).



The defendants are said to have bribed employees of the Minnesota non-profit organisation, Feeding Our Future, to sponsor numerous sham distribution sites.



These sites claimed to be serving meals to thousands of children a day within just days or weeks of being formed, said the DoJ.



But they were instead submitting false paperwork using bogus children’s names.



The Department said that the accused used the proceeds to buy luxury cars, as well as property in the US, Kenya and Turkey, and to fund international travel.



The suspects face charges including wire fraud, money laundering and bribery, the BBC reported.



However, Feeding Our Future has denied any wrongdoing.



A lawyer for the organisation’s founder, Aimee Bock, told the BBC: “We have maintained our innocence from the first day.”



He said the indictment was “merely the beginning of the criminal process” and represented a “mere allegation”.



This development comes after the DoJ in March had brought over 1,000 criminal cases involving losses of $1.1 billion and was involved in civil litigation alleging fraud in more than $6 billion of loans.

DeSantis, a Republican, sent two planes of undocumented migrants to Martha’s Vineyard, last week, to “facilitate the transport of illegal immigrants to sanctuary jurisdictions”…reports Asian Lite News

A group of migrants currently in the US have filed a class action lawsuit against Florida officials who sent them to Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, last week.



The lawsuit, filed on Tuesday in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleged that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and the state’s transportation secretary “impermissibly interfered with the federal government’s exclusive control over immigration in furtherance of an unlawful goal and a personal political agenda”, reports Xinhua news agency.



DeSantis, a Republican, sent two planes of undocumented migrants to Martha’s Vineyard, last week, to “facilitate the transport of illegal immigrants to sanctuary jurisdictions”.



He is among several Republican governors who have relocated migrants to northern parts of the US in protest of President Joe Biden’s immigration policies.



Texas Governor Greg Abbott has also sent thousands of migrants to Washington, D.C., New York City, and Chicago, while his Arizona counterpart Doug Ducey has bused individuals to the US capital.



Democrats have responded by accusing the Republicans of using the migrants as political pawns.



Reports that a plane carrying migrants was heading to Biden’s home state of Delaware drew wide attention on Tuesday.



White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Tuesday that the Biden administration was aware of the reports that a plane was heading to Delaware.



“We’ve been closely coordinating with the folks in Delaware, the officials in Delaware,” Jean-Pierre said, adding that they had not been in touch with DeSantis.



So far this year, federal agents have made about 1.82 million arrests at the country’s southern border, according to figures released by the Customs and Border Protection.

82,"Putin's military mobilisation sparks protests and an exodus from Russia
The cries of ""no to war"" are once again sweeping across Russia. From St. Petersburg to Yakutsk, citizens have once again taken to the streets to show their rejection of the war and the partial military mobilisation announced by President Vladimir Putin. According to the independent protest monitoring group OVD-Info, at least 1,386 people have been arrested in 38 cities across the country. Moscow and St. Petersburg are the metropolises where the most arrests have been reported, 509 and 541 respectively.

In the capital, OVD-Info reports that a girl lost consciousness as a result of beatings by security forces and that the authorities used the metro's facial recognition system to arrest citizens. The monitoring group also reports that in four Moscow police departments, those arrested were handed summonses to the military registration and enlistment office.

""No to mobilisation"" and the mythical ""no to war"" were among the slogans chanted by the demonstrators, although there were also references to the government, specifically Putin. ""Send Putin to the trenches!"" citizens in St. Petersburg, the president's hometown, shouted.

""Why are you serving Putin, a man who has been in power for 20 years?"" one young protester shouted at the politician, AFP reports. ""You fucking bald-headed nutcase. He's not going to drop a bomb and we'll all still protect him,"" a woman in Yekaterinburg told AP, referring to the Russian president.

During the demonstrations, citizens expressed their fear of the military mobilisation. ""Why are they deciding my future for me? I'm afraid for me, for my brother,"" one student told AFP. ""The most valuable thing they can take from us is our children's lives. I will not give them my son's life,"" said another protester in Moscow.

Similar demonstrations were held in the Siberian city of Ulan Ude, where one citizen called for ""no orphaned children"". ""We want our fathers, husbands and brothers to stay alive, stop the war and don't take our people away,"" she said, according to CNN.

The Russian Interior Ministry described the protests as ""unauthorised actions with an extremely small number of participants"" in a statement carried by Russian news agencies. ""All of these were detained. Those who violated the laws were detained and taken to police stations for investigation,"" the statement added.

Shortly after Russia began its brutal invasion of Ukraine, thousands of Russian citizens took to the streets of different cities for several days to protest against the ""special military operation"". The authorities crushed the demonstrations with violence and tightened laws against freedom of speech and assembly, raising the prison sentence to 15 years for participating in the marches.

For months there were no major protests, but the military mobilisation reignited the spark of discontent with the war and the government. From 24 February to 21 September, 16,500 arrests and 245 criminal charges have been reported, according to OVD-Info data.

The draft has angered Russian citizens. 300,000 ""military experienced"" men between the ages of 18 and 65 will join the war in Ukraine. 300,000 men who, as the Vesna peace movement claims, ""will be thrown into the meat grinder"". According to the latest official figures, 5,937 Russian soldiers have lost their lives during the invasion. However, the real figure could be much higher.

US intelligence reports estimated in early August between 75,000 and 80,000 casualties since the beginning of the war. Ukraine, for its part, claims that its armed forces eliminated some 51,900 Russian troops between 24 February and 9 September, noting that 650 Russians were killed on 8 September alone - during the counteroffensive in the east of the country. ""This regime has condemned itself and is destroying its youth,"" a 60-year-old Russian citizen told AFP.

Desperation to escape Russia

Putin's announcement has angered the population, sparking mass protests. Other consequences of the military mobilisation have been a major Russian exodus to countries where citizens do not need visas, such as Turkey, Armenia, Serbia and Georgia.

Shortly after the speech, airline ticket prices rose and many sold out within hours. Istanbul, Yerevan and Belgrade are some of the destinations that are no longer available on Russian airline websites. The same has happened with direct flights to Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan.

In the absence of flights, many citizens have opted to escape across land borders. Finnish border guards told Reuters they had noticed an ""exceptional number"" of Russians trying to cross the border overnight.

According to the news agency, more than 4,800 Russians arrived in Finland the same day the partial military mobilisation was announced. The same has happened on the border with Georgia, Mongolia and Kazakhstan. The media outlet RFE/RL even spoke of a ""collapse"" on the Russian-Georgian border.

Unsurprisingly, the Kremlin has dismissed this information as 'false', claiming that the increase in border traffic is 'highly exaggerated'. In order to curb the mass flight of citizens, Moscow has reportedly banned airlines from selling tickets to men between the ages of 18 and 65. A Telegram channel has reported several cases in which border guards have banned men of military age from leaving the country.

The current exodus is in addition to the one that began in February, shortly after the invasion. Many Russians chose to leave the country for fear of being called up or to avoid the economic consequences of sanctions imposed against Moscow.

83,"Zelensky calls for withdrawal of Russia's veto at the UN
In the framework of the UN General Assembly, which is now in its third day, the President of Ukraine, Volodymir Zelensky, has denounced the ""destruction"" that Russia is causing in his country. For this reason, the Ukrainian president has proposed a five-point ""formula for peace"" in the Assembly itself, demanding that the rest of the member countries punish Moscow.

In his speech, made via video, Zelensky denounced the fact that ""a crime has been committed against Ukraine"" and for this reason ""we demand a just punishment"". In his appearance, dressed in his usual green military shirt, he insisted that his country ""wants peace"" but that, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian country has been forced to fight and is now demonstrating ""its strength on the battlefield"".

AFP/UKRAINIAN PRESIDENTIAL PRESS SERVICE - Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelenski looks at a map during a visit to a Ukrainian army position

Zelensky also insisted that ""Russia wants war"" and blamed Moscow for the fact that when it talks about negotiating, it mobilises reservists or referendums on the annexation of areas occupied by the Russian army. Zelensky proposed reaching an agreement to end the conflict on the basis of principles set by his country: a comprehensive punishment of Russia for the aggression, protection of life, restoration of Ukraine's security and territorial integrity, security guarantees and the country's determination to continue defending itself.

As punishment, the Ukrainian president continues to call for sanctions and a trade embargo on relations with Moscow, as well as the withdrawal of its voting rights in international bodies such as the Security Council, visa restrictions for Russians and the creation of a specific tribunal to try ""war crimes"". Ukraine accuses Russia of having committed such crimes during its offensives, such as in Bucha and Izium, a territory recently liberated by Ukraine, where more than 400 corpses have been found in mass graves.

AFP/ANATOLII STEPANOV - Ukrainian soldiers in a trench on the front line with Russian troops in the Lugansk region

In this regard, the Ukrainian leader said that ""Russia wants to spend the winter in the occupied territory of Ukraine and prepare its forces to attempt a new offensive. New Buchas, new Iziums..."".

Zelensky also spoke harshly about the countries that have stood aside in condemning the Russian invasion, saying that ""those who talk about neutrality when human values and peace are under attack are talking about something else. They are talking about indifference"".

Alongside this, and in order to continue to be able to stand up to Russia, Zelensky again called for more military support, with an emphasis on long-range weapons and air defences, as well as greater financial assistance to ""maintain internal stability"" and ""support the population"".

In conclusion, the Ukrainian president was optimistic about the course of the war, saying that they have the capacity to ""return the Ukrainian flag to the whole of our territory. We can do it with force of arms, but we need time"".

Putin threatens nuclear weapons

Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to accuse the West of having created this war, a term he has used for the first time since the beginning of his invasion, after trying to ""destroy Russia"". As a result, Putin has once again flaunted his nuclear arsenal, declaring that he is prepared to respond with nuclear weapons.

Following this threat, Putin mobilised 300,000 Russian reservists to go to the front lines, which has provoked a mass exodus of Russian citizens who say they do not want to fight ""or die for Putin"". This is the first Russian mobilisation since the Second World War, a mobilisation which, moreover, aims to achieve Putin's main objective: to ""liberate"" the Donbas region, a region in which, according to him, the citizens do not want to return to living ""under the yoke"" of Ukraine.

He also expressed his full support for the referendums announced to be held on 23 and 27 September in the Ukrainian regions of Lugansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporiyia to join the Russian Federation. He also indicated in his latest address to the nation that, in order to defend their borders, ""they will use all possible means"", so that if there is an attack on these territories it is possible that Russia will consider it an attack on the country.",UN|UN|General|Assembly|Assembly|A|##FP|UK|##RA|##IN|##IA|##N|##im|Security|Council|I|AN|Z|
84,"How the New Brunswick government plans to tackle climate change
For the first time, the New Brunswick government is publicizing its climate change targets.

In an updated plan, the province is committing to lowering emissions 46 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. It is at 37 per cent now.

The plan aims to reach net zero by 2050. But, the province says that will depend on moving its electrical grid from fossil fuels to renewables.

“The plan commits to expanding energy efficiency programs. It commits to the strategy,” said Louise Comeau, director of the Conservation Council of New Brunswick’s climate change and energy solutions program.

""So for today, I’m taking these as positive signals, realizing all the while that we also have headwinds that I would say could undermine the plan if we go down the wrong path.”

The conservation council says it supports what it’s seen so far and that NB Power has shown openness to accepting clean electricity as the norm, not the exception.

Over the next two years, the government says it is committed to delivering on 14 of the 30 actions in the plan. These will include:

Supporting the transition to zero-emission freight by implementing an incentive program and completing a zero-emission freight strategy.

Setting clear electricity efficiency performance targets and reporting requirements for NB Power.

Ensuring New Brunswickers have equitable access to energy efficiency programs through long-term financing and/or payment options.

Supporting regional service commissions in developing and implementing regional transportation plans.

Developing a performance standard to ensure landfill gas management systems are meeting requirements related to increased methane capture and reduced emissions.

Maintaining biodiversity by publishing a list of climate-sensitive species and setting a new target for protected areas.

The province says the remaining 16 actions, such as assessing the carbon stock of forests and wetlands, and training tradespeople in skills related to energy-efficient buildings, will take longer than two years to complete.",Conservation|Council|of|New|Brunswick|N|##B|Power|N|##B|Power|New|Brunswick|

86,"New York attorney general sues Trump for fraud over family business
NEW YORK — Donald Trump and three of his children have been hit by a fraud lawsuit after a New York investigation into their family company — the Trump Organization.



It alleges that they lied ""by billions"" about the value of real estate in order to get loans and pay less tax. Prosecutors say the Trump Organization committed numerous acts of fraud between 2011 and 2021.



Trump has dismissed the lawsuit as ""another witch hunt"".



Two executives at the Trump Organization, Allen Weisselberg and Jeffrey McConney, were named as defendants alongside the former president and his eldest children, Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric Trump.



The lawsuit has been brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is the state's most senior lawyer, after a three-year civil investigation.



Her office does not have the power to file criminal charges, but is referring allegations of criminal wrongdoing to federal prosecutors and to the Internal Revenue Service.



""With the help of his children and senior executives at the Trump Organization, Donald Trump falsely inflated his net worth by billions of dollars to unjustly enrich himself and cheat the system,"" James said in a statement.



She said Trump's own apartment in Trump Tower, which was valued at $327 million (£288m), was among the properties whose values were allegedly misrepresented.



""No apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount,"" James added.



""White collar financial crime is not a victimless crime,"" the attorney general said.



""When the well-connected break the law to take in more money than they are entitled to, it reduces resources available to working people, to regular people, to small businesses and to all tax payers.""



James, who wants to recover an estimated $250 million (£220m) that she said was the result of fraud, dubbed the situation ""the art of the steal"".



She is asking a court to bar the former president and his children from serving as officers or directors in any New York business.



She also wants the Trump Organization banned from engaging in real estate transactions there for five years.



The announcement comes after James — a Democrat who is running for re-election in November — rejected at least one offer to settle the long-running civil investigation into the company's business practices.



Blasting the lawsuit on his Truth Social site, Trump branded James, who is black, a racist.



""Another Witch Hunt by a racist Attorney General, Letitia James, who failed in her run for Governor, getting almost zero support from the public,"" he wrote.



On Twitter, Donald Trump Jr accused James of ""weaponizing her office to go after her political opponents"".



In August Trump declined to answer questions during an interview at the attorney general's office connected to this civil investigation. James said he repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right to not self-incriminate, confirming only his name.



James said that Eric Trump did the same more than 500 times in a 2020 deposition.



Tristan Snell, a lawyer and former prosecutor who worked on a separate case against Trump University, told the BBC that the lawsuit could take a year to go to trial.



But the potential of such a trial could severely restrict Trump's ability to do business in New York and profit from his marquee real estate holdings in New York City.



It could trigger a series of financial consequences that would make it harder for him to raise capital and maintain credit, Snell said.



""It definitely could be ruinous for him,"" Snell said. The lawsuit is one of a number of legal issues the former president is facing.



On Aug. 8, the FBI conducted a search warrant at his home in Mar-a-Lago as part of an investigation into his handling of classified records.



He is also being investigated in Georgia in relation to efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. He has also denied any wrongdoing in those investigations. — BBC",NE|##W|Y|##OR|##K|Trump|Organization|Trump|Organization|Trump|Organization|Internal|Revenue|Service|Trump|Organization|New|Organization|Truth|Social|

What information has been stolen?

It's been reported that up to 2.8 million phone and internet users could have had all of their information stolen, including their passport and driver licence numbers, email and home addresses, dates of birth and telephone numbers.

A further seven million have had only their dates of birth, email addresses and phone numbers compromised in what's considered to be one of the biggest cyber attacks in Australian history.

It’s understood hackers exploited a weakness in Optus’ firewall, The Australian reported.

Payment details and account passwords have not been compromised, Optus confirmed.

What is being done about the Optus breach?

The telecommunications company says it is working with the Australian Cyber Security Centre to limit any risk to current and former customers.

The Australian Federal Police, the Office of the Australian Information Regulator and other key regulators have also been notified.

""We are devastated to discover that we have been subject to a cyberattack that has resulted in the disclosure of our customers’ personal information to someone who shouldn’t see it,"" Kelly Bayer Rosmarin, Optus CEO, said in a statement on Thursday.

""As soon as we knew, we took action to block the attack and began an immediate investigation. While not everyone maybe affected and our investigation is not yet complete, we want all of our customers to be aware of what has happened as soon as possible so that they can increase their vigilance.

Story continues

""We are very sorry and understand customers will be concerned. Please be assured that we are working hard, and engaging with all the relevant authorities and organisations, to help safeguard our customers as much as possible.""

Optus customers urged to have 'heightened awareness'

Optus is not yet aware of any customers that have been directly harmed and Optus services remain safe to use and operate as per normal.

But customers are encouraged to have ""heightened awareness across their accounts"".

This includes looking out for unusual or fraudulent activity and any notifications which seem odd or suspicious.

88,"Delhi Traffic Police adds Bhramastra's ""Belt-Astra"" Twist to Spread Road Safety Awareness.
Delhi Police has recently undertaken a drive as part of awareness campaign to ensure passengers in the rear seat of cars wear seat belts to prevent casualties.

Delhi Traffic Police chose evoke dialogues from Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt's recent movie Brahmastra to drive home the importance of seat belts to ensure road safety in case of accidents. In its recent social media post, Delhi Traffic Police highlighted how seat belts can actually be the weapon one needs to avoid serious injuries, even death, amid calls to make seat belts on all seats mandatory. The Centre recently came up with a draft rule that will also make rear seat belt alarm compulsory in coming days.

Delhi Police has recently undertaken a drive as part of awareness campaign to ensure passengers in the rear seat of cars wear seat belts to prevent casualties. The campaign, that began last week, has already seen the cops issue challan to more than 50 people for not wearing seat belts on backseats. According to traffic rules, commuters found violating rear seat belt rule will be fined ₹1,000.

The Centre plans to enforce the use of rear seatbelts after the recent death of Cyrus Mistry, former chairman of Tata Motors, in a car crash. Mistry was found not wearing seat belts at the backseat of a luxury SUV before it crashed. According to preliminary investigations, the safety overlook from Mistry was one of the reasons why airbags at the rear did not deploy on impact and led to his death.

Road accident deaths are one of the highest in the norther part of the country. Last year, over 1,900 people died in Delhi in road accidents. Most of these accidents were caused due to drivers' negligence, or safety oversight from passengers in rear seats. A recent report by the Centre revealed that more than 15,000 people lost their lives in accidents because they were not wearing seatbelts at the rear.

India is one of the top countries when it comes to number of road accidents or deaths every year across the world. The number of road accidents in India increased by 12 per cent last year compared to 2020. Number of people who lost their lives due to road mishaps went up by nearly 17 per cent from 1.33 lakh deaths in 2020. According to World Bank's statement last year, in India, one person dies every four minutes in road accidents.

When it comes to safety protocols. wearing seatbelts is mandatory for all occupants in a car in India. However, many occupants flout this protocol, especially the passengers at the back of cars. The enforcement of this rule, so far, has been weak.

91,"DeSantis Hit With Lawsuit Over Martha’s Vineyard Migrant Stunt
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is facing a lawsuit after illegally flying asylum seekers to Martha’s Vineyard in a cruel and premeditated stunt.

On Tuesday, Lawyers for Civil Rights filed a federal class action suit against the controversial state leader. The Boston-based attorney firm claimed that DeSantis not only coerced the Venezuelan immigrants but also made false promises to them purposely. The claim states DeSantis used COVID-19 relief funds to cover the tab.

In the controversial incident, DeSantis ordered people to walk the streets near migrant shelters in Texas, pretending to offer housing assistance, employment, and even $10 McDonald’s gift cards. The catch was that the immigrants had to go to Boston or Washington D.C. to receive the non-existent resources.

The suit comes as DeSantis has waged war against Democrats who support immigrants by vowing to transport migrants by the dozens to blue states. Lawyers for Civil Rights are pleading with a judge to block him from doing so, stating that the controversial Governor is using the immigrants as “political pawns.” While his actions have caused outrage, fellow Republicans are praising DeSantis and doing the same. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has also boasted about transporting thousands of migrants from the southern border to other major cities such as New York City, Chicago, and Washington. Once there and unfamiliar with U.S. laws and services, the migrants are left to crowd the streets and local shelters.

Luckily, the immigrants shipped to Martha’s Vineyard were aided by the community, including the local St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church. They provided shelter and food for the over 50 people who arrived there by way of DeSantis.

However, as a result, Bexar County, Texas, Sheriff Javier Salazar announced that his office would investigate whether or not any crimes were committed against the immigrants.",De|##S|##anti|St|Law|##yers|for|Civil|Rights|Civil|Rights|

A Simcoe County man will spend five years behind bars after pleading guilty to extortion charges for luring two children to engage in sexual activity online.

Shiva Dhanna, 26, of Innisfil, Ont., was arrested more than three years ago by South Simcoe Police officers, who alleged he used social media to befriend a 12-year-old girl.

Police said Dhanna convinced the young girl to engage in sexual activity online and that he took screenshots of her actions to extort her.

At the time, the RCMP in Saskatchewan was also investigating the then 23-year-old man.

Investigators found Dhanna engaged in an online relationship with a child in the United States, identified by police as another alleged victim.

On Tuesday, the court heard he convinced a 15-year-old girl from Savannah, Georgia, who he met online to board a Greyhound bus to move to Canada; however, the Department of Homeland Security said the girl never arrived.

Investigators claimed to have found roughly 1,000 child pornographic images and videos on Dhanna's laptop while searching his home on the 9th Line east of the 25th Sideroad in Innisfil.

A psychiatrist diagnosed the 26-year-old Innisfil man as a pedophile and at a high risk of reoffending.

Police believe there could be more victims.

Upon his release, Dhanna is prohibited from contacting anyone under 18 and using the internet or social media networks to communicate with minors for 20 years.",##m|##coe|South|##m|##coe|Police|RC|##MP|Grey|##hound|Department|of|Homeland|Security|

US SANCTIONS

The police chief made headlines at the end of last year, when the US imposed sanctions on him and six other officials who once worked for RAB. Washington made the decision on Dec 10, 2021, citing ‘serious human rights abuses’ by the agency.

In response, Dhaka summoned the US ambassador to express its dissatisfaction with the decision. But Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen later said it would require a lengthy process for the US to lift the sanctions.

The move had cast doubts over Benazir's ability to travel to the US in future. But he went to New York as part of a Bangladeshi delegation led by Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan for the United Nations Chiefs of Police Summit. The summit was held at the UN Headquarters from Aug 31 to Sept 1.

When the sanctions against the RAB were announced last year, the US Treasury Department said there were ""widespread allegations of serious human rights abuses"" by the force amid the Bangladesh government's war on drugs. This, according to Washington, threatened US national security interests by ""undermining the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, and Bangladesh's economic progress"".

Citing allegations made by non-governmental organisations, the Treasury Department said the RAB and other law enforcement agencies in Bangladesh were responsible for more than 600 disappearances since 2009 and nearly 600 extrajudicial killings and instances of torture since 2018.

Benazir, who was appointed as the head of Bangladesh Police in 2020 after a five-year stint as director general of the RAB, spoke about the issue on Sept 2.

Raising questions about the sanctions at an event in New York, Benazir said, ""They [the US] alleged that 600 people have gone missing under the RAB's watch since 2009. But I joined the force in 2015. So why am I included in the list?”

""I don't want to blame the US administration or Americans because this was done by those who did not support Bangabandhu [Sheikh Mujibur Rahman] in the 1970 elections and opposed the Liberation War of 1971.",RA|##B|United|Nations|Chiefs|of|Police|Summit|UN|RA|##B|US|Treasury|Department|Treasury|Department|RA|##B|Bangladesh|Police|RA|##B|RA|##B|
96,"Regulatory Hurdles Slow Crypto Adoption in India & Pakistan, Chainalysis Report Reveals
Hostile regulatory environments see India and Pakistan crypto adoption fall sharply, a new Chainalysis report reveals.

India, once home to the second-largest crypto-loving demographic in the world, has seen its crypto adoption ranking drop to fourth place year-on-year, according to a 2022 Chainalysis report. Its neighbor, Pakistan, is now the country with the sixth-highest crypto adoption rate in the world, falling three places during the same period.

According to the report, most Indian transactions involve ETH or wrapped ETH, while most Pakistani transactions use stablecoins as bearers of value for remittances. One ETH can be converted to an ERC-20 token like wETH in a 1:1 ratio for use in decentralized applications and NFT marketplaces.

In both countries, blockchain companies in the remittance space are beginning to disrupt the market, cumulatively worth over $40 billion. The Pakistani government recently partnered with AliPay to receive remittances from Malaysia.

Stiff taxes slash Indian trading volumes.

Two new taxes introduced this year drove the drop in India’s ranking.

Indian crypto exchanges were hit hard by the 30% tax imposed by the government on cryptocurrency earnings in Apr. 2022. Local news outlets estimated a 15-55% drop in trading volumes in the days that followed. Internet traffic to crypto exchanges fell 40%.

WazirX, an Indian exchange that faced probes earlier this year by India’s Enforcement Directorate, saw its trading volume drop from $208 million to a little under $100 million before the new law came into effect. A further 1% tax deducted at source came into effect on July 1, 2022.

Despite the declines, one industry executive is still bullish.

According to Vikram Rangala of Indian exchange ZebPay, “India has dozens of [crypto] projects working on establishing property rights, accessing tickets and membership passes, helping rural artisans monetize, even giving token holders the chance “to go skydiving with a movie star in Dubai,” and more.”

He also offered a theory on the government’s reasoning,” From the conversations I and my colleagues have had, people in the Indian government, including members of parliament, aren’t anti-crypto per se. Some are very pro-crypto. But they’re worried about their constituents trading a volatile asset without adequate information. No public servant can be seen backing something that’s so risky for most people. “

On the other hand, Pakistan’s government has yet to rule on the legality of cryptocurrencies. The central bank and the government recommended a complete ban against cryptocurrencies in January 2022. After that, the government formed three subcommittees to help implement policies.

Complicating matters is adding the country to the gray list of the Financial Action Task Force, limiting the country’s avenues to get financial aid.

Central bank governor Reza Baqir said in Feb. 2022 that cryptocurrencies’ downsides negate their benefits.

Overall, NFTs and stablecoins account for most crypto volume

Taking the top spot on Chainalysis’s crypto adoption index for the second year was Vietnam, while the runner-up was the Philippines. Both can attribute their high rankings to the penetration of play-to-earn(P2E) games like Axie Infinity that require using NFTs, and also to stablecoin remittances.

According to Manan Vora, a senior official at Liminial, a Singaporean crypto wallet infrastructure provider, stablecoins offer children sending money to parents in Vietnam and the Philippines a cheaper way to transact.

“Why pay 3% to a banking intermediary and wait two days for the funds to reach them when USDT/USDC can reach them within one minute, with almost zero fees?” he said.

97,"AI startup Ada cuts 16 percent of its workforce
CEO cites tightening economy as Ada cuts 78 positions.

Artificial intelligence (AI) startup Ada is the latest tech firm to announce layoffs amid tightening market conditions.

Mike Murchison, Ada’s CEO and co-founder, said in a LinkedIn post on September 20 that he’d made the “difficult decision to reduce Ada’s workforce and part ways with 78 talented people who helped build Ada into what it is today.”

The reduction represents 16 percent of Ada’s team. “I know this will be hard on many of you, and harder still for those affected,” Murchison wrote in a letter sent to Ada employees and shared on LinkedIn.

The majority of the layoffs have impacted marketing, sales, and recruitment within the Canadian unicorn’s team.

Murchison said the reductions came in response to a tightening of the economy, and an increased focus in terms of the startup’s new product strategy. However, it wasn’t immediately clear what defines Ada’s new product strategy.

Ada is the latest tech startup to announce layoffs during the current economic slump. Most recently, SkipTheDishes said it was letting go of 350 employees in mid-September, joining the list of large tech companies that have made staff cuts, and which have cited the need to grow sustainably amid the current market conditions.

According to layoff tracking website Layoffs.fyi, 630 tech companies from across the world have cut a combined 80,902 employees so far this year.

In his letter, Murchison explained that significant changes in the tech industry have led to a higher cost of capital, placing significant pressure on digital-first brands that often rely on outside capital to fund operations.

As a result of the economic uncertainty and difficulties obtaining funding, many startups have tightened up their budgets. For Ada, the squeeze in budgets has led to fewer customers than the startup originally forecast.

“We grew our team assuming demand would be similar to what we’ve experienced over the last five years,” Murchison wrote. “I take full responsibility for those assumptions.” It’s a similar sentiment to that echoed by Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke when it came to overestimating the growth of e-commerce and over-hiring.

Ada, which touts itself as “the leader in automated customer experience,” offers an AI chatbot for large brands. Ada achieved unicorn status last year with its $130 million Series C round. The startup had previously raised $63.7 million CAD in Series B funding, a $19 million Series A round, and $2.5 million in seed financing.

Murchison explained the reduction in staff would remove Ada’s dependence on outside capital while maintaining the startup’s focus on winning enterprise customer support.

Ada said it would offer the following support to departing employees: two-and-a-half months severance; extended benefits to access mental health, financial services, and others services; a number of programs including outplacement services to help those impacted; and the ability to keep all home office and IT equipment that Ada provided.

Murchison wrote that despite the headwinds, customer retention is strong, the startup’s financial position is solid, close rates remain consistent, and Ada’s product strategy is resonating with customers.

“As we’ve demonstrated throughout our history, we will get through this challenging period and emerge stronger on the other side with focus, drive, and kindness,” Murchison wrote.",Ada|Ada|Ada|Ada|Link|##ed|##I|##n|Ada|Ada|Ada|Ada|Link|##ed|##I|##n|Ada|Ada|Ski|##T|##he|##D|##ishes|Lay|f|Ada|R|Ada|CP|Shop|L|Ada|

The move comes as Shopify has seen its stock price drop sharply from its pandemic high amid the broader tech selloff and return of physical retail.

According to Jombone co-founder and CEO Sumit Sahdev, the sector has been working “in an antiquated fashion” for decades, relying on inefficient, expensive, and highly manual processes to find, hire, manage, and pay workers.

“There has been no innovation in this industry for a very, very long time,” Sumit Sahdev told BetaKit in an interview.
